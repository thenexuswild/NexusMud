live
in here, for the toys are strewn everywhere, the bed isn't made,
and
small little kangaroo clothes are in piles on the floor and the
back of
the chair at the desk.  Poor Kanga must despair over this room,
for it
doesn't look like it's ever been clean, or ever will be in the
near
future..  You look around for Roo, but he is not here.  He must be
out
playing in his favorite sand pit.

The
sunlight filters gently through the leaves of the green trees, and
the
birds sing sweetly.  The scent of flowers fills your nose, as does
the
crisp, clean air.  Fallen leaves and pine needles crackle under
your feet
as you make your way among the trees.  But this part of the forest
seems
different somehow.  You find yourself with and increasing tendency
to get
lost here.  There must be some way out, though...

Desc       You enter the sparkling, clear stream that bubbles along merrily
over
rocks, twisting and turning through the Hundred Acre Woods.  The
water
feels cool and refreshing.  You shield your eyes from the
brightness as
the sun shines off the small ripples, and you can see many little
fish
swimming along in the waters.

walking
down the rows of lettuce and carrots, radishes and tomatoes,
cabbages and
cucumbers.  Rabbit seems to have everything he needs growing in
his
little garden in this clearing.

The

Perhaps
you should climb up and see who it is.

Desc       All around you is the peaceful forest of the Hundred Acre Woods.
The
sunlight filters gently through the leaves of the green trees, and
the
birds sing sweetly.  The scent of flowers fills your nose, as does
the
crisp, clean air.  Fallen leaves and pine needles crackle under
your feet
as you make your way among the trees.  But this part of the forest
seems
different somehow.  You find yourself with an increasing tendency
to get
lost here.  There must be some way out, though...

always
so sad and gloomy, since this is the gloomiest place you've ever
been.
Everything is grey and wet and even though you are quite sure the
sun was
shining brightly when you were in the forest, it doesn't seem as

Rabbit

a
knocker.  This is terribly impressive to Pooh.  But poor Owl can't
even
spell his own name very well, and he goes all to pieces over great
big
long words like 'measles' and 'buttered toast'.  So Christopher
Robin
wrote two very lovely signs for him to put on his door.  The one
next to
the knocker says, 'Ples ring if an rnser is reqird,' and the one
next to
the bell-pull says, 'Plez cnoke if an rnsr is not reqid.'

The
sunlight filters gently through the leaves of the green trees, and
the
birds sing sweetly.  The scent of flowers fills your nose, as does
the
crisp, clean air.  Fallen leaves and pine needles crackle under
your feet
as you make your way among the trees.

empty honey
pot on the floor.  Pooh is standing by the shelf, counting his
full
ones.  '...thirteen...fourteen...fifteen..,' he says as you
approach,
'Oh, hallo there!'  Then he looks back at the shelf ponderingly,
'Was I
on fourteen or fifteen?  Oh well, I'll say twenty I suppose.'

Desc       All around you is the peaceful forest of the Hundred Acre Woods.
The
sunlight filters gently through the leaves of the green trees, and
the
birds sing sweetly.  The scent of flowers fills your nose, as does
the
crisp, clean air.  Fallen leaves and pine needles crackle under
your feet
as you make your way among the trees.

heffalumps.
You think you can see some tracks that one left behind, but you
don't see
the heffalump anywhere about.  You really should get out of here
QUICK
though since this is a TRAP and you wouldn't want to get caught in
it.
