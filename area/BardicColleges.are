who is master of all, now awaits to administer your last exam to
you before you can receive the harp she now plays.  Hope you can
survive this final test.

against his beliefs to let you, or anyone else for that matter, do
anything without his giving you a hard time first.  Jeez, you just

Desc       Gazing at you with eyes rich with life and talent, the Anonymous Bard offers 
you a chance to learn the true beauty of music.  The bard's gentle music 
suggests the beauty and mystery of a female musician, yet the strong 
undertones suggest that of a male.  The bard is neither, yet both, combining 
the best of both to create a harmony of life, love, and magic.  "This gift I 
offer you if you are willing to learn," the bard says.  "Prove your worth of 
receiving such a fine gift."  The bard then awaits your reply.

blends into a glorious red that lights up the descending black of night.  
Thousands of glowing yellow lights span the horizon like fireflies or 
glowing candles.  The breeze lazily blows around your hair, relaxing you.

Desc          Because you've always wondered what the conductor's office looked 
like, you gingerly tiptoe into it since she left it unlocked.  At
first you notice the tick tock of her metronome, which is sitting
on a desk.  It still keeps time even though no music is playing
now.

musician's instruments are fine-tuned by skilled craftsmen.  The
walls of this hallway have been decorated with a mosaic of music
with various notes.

many times in it trying to get those harmonies right.  You see 
various awards, plaques, and certificates as well as posters from
musicals lining the walls, but the object you are most interested
in is inside a desk in the corner of the room.  Your director
loved to use the pitch-pipe often to make sure that acappella 
singers always had started on the right note.

to earn your recorder.  As you hit the top, you notice a sickly,
obnoxious tune coming from a corner of the room.  As you look,
you notice another animated instrument.  This time it is a 
recorder holding your recorder.  And who ever said Bardic College

He grunts and snorts angrily as he looks down at what little
creature has ruined his nap.  He rolls on the floor laughing at
you, then flexes his muscles once before he hits you.

touches on a shiny silver flute.  Noticing your presence, he
glances up from his work and glares angrily at you.  "How dare
you disturb me while I'm creating," he says.  "For that, I'll 
have to charge you double what I normally charge for these
flutes!"  With a hrmph, he goes back to his work.  Ilwar has 
always been known for his friendliness.

gymnasium than anything.  A series of tests with battle masters await
you to the north, but first you must get past the shmuck blocking your
way into the practice areas.  Too bad he doesn't seem like the most
helpful person around.

Desc          You are standing inside the Anstruth Building awaiting your final
exams in each of the areas of instruments.  You've studied long and 
hard for this moment, and now you must defend your knowledge of each
instrument area against the masters who will be throwing hard punches
at you.  If you use the skills you have mastered, you should be able
to pass.  The building seems to spiral out around you, disorienting
you a bit, or perhaps it seems to do that since you are rather 
nervous.  As you look up, you notice the Dean's office.  As you look
down, you notice the most obvious deathtrap in the whole world of
HoloMud.  Good luck on your finals!

Desc          You've finally made it to the Master of Wood-winds' office.
Apparently her songs lead you in the right direction.  Yet this
office looks more like a meadow than a room inside a building.
There's a tall, willowy tree with a swing hanging from the
branches next to a babbling brook.  A quaint gazebo stands near
the brook.  The images are peaceful, yet rather absurd here, then
you realize they are being created by the melodies played by
the Master, who rests inside the gazebo.

Desc          Blats and bleets of trumpets rudely interrupt your concentration
as you make your way toward your final with the Master of Brass.  
Suddenly you can't help but dance your way toward the jazzy rhythms
coming from what sounds like a wild party at the end of the passageway.

Desc          As you dance your way into this room swinging to the Dixieland
jazz rhythms, you realize you have entered the office of the Master
of Brass.  So, how in the heck did you end up on Bourbon Street in
the middle of Mardi Gras?  As you watch all the masqueraders dancing
wildly to the bleeting brassy sounds, you realize the images have
been created by the Master, who stands on a bandstand in the middle
of the party blowing his heart out on a tenor sax and dancing.
Wouldn't you like to party with him now?

Desc          Pounding and stomping wildly to the drum beats in your soul, you
enter the office of the Master of Percussion.  Yet you feel out of
place as you have entered an obvious war dance in a small African
village.  Natives dance, screech, howl, and stomp madly before you to
the same rhythms of the kettle and war drums that lead you here.
As the costumed dancers beckon for you to join them in their ritual,
you notice the Master of Percussion standing near a huge bonfire working
up a sweat as he pounds his soul out into the massive kettle drums
before him.  You suddenly realize his energies have created these
images, and now you must pass your final with him.

Desc          As you waltz into the room, you realize you've just entered the
office of the Master of Strings.  Yet you feel as if you've intruded
on a private performance for the Archbishop of Salzburg in the 18th
century.  Several white-wigged guests in elaborately tailored
royal clothes turn toward you and put their fingers to their lips.
You politely sit down quietly and watch the quartet pour their
hearts into the lovely chamber music that now surrounds you.  Moved
to tears, you watch a solitary player pouring her soul and creating
the lovely music that lead you here.  You suddenly realize that this
is the Master of Strings, and that her beautiful music is creating
these images before you now.  You do not wish to disturb such a 
moving scene, but you realize that now you must pass your final
with her.

Desc          As you walk up the ivory stairway into the Dean of Bards' office,
you hear music unlike anything you've ever heard on this world before.
The music is almost angelic, heavenly.  Several voices in gaelic combine
into a harmonic whole and are accompanied by the intricate yet peaceful
melodies of a golden harp.  You feel as though you are drifting away
from the earth and floating on fluffy clouds toward the music.  Then
you notice that only one singer is arts and accompanying
herself on the golden harp.  You wonder how is possible for one person
to create all this lovely music surrounding you now, then you realize
that this is the Dean of Bards, who is master of all, and now you must
pass your last final before you can receive your instrument from her.
Good luck!

Desc          Well, you were going to try to sneak into you last test quietly,
but the loud thud you made as you clumsily landed on the floot didn't
exactly help you out there.  As you look around the office, you
suddenly realize that you have entered an instrument shop.  Beautiful
stringed guitars carved out of wood by skilled craftsmen line
the walls of this room.  The President, who was strumming a fine
double-stringed guitar and humming a tune, starts at your loud
entrance.  He then eyes you carefully, sizing you up.  He says, 
"I've been expecting you.  You were long overdue to graduate from 
here awhile back.  Now let's see if you've studied hard enough and
are worthy of this fine instrument!"  As he quickly wields a weapon
and laughs, he says, "Welcome to your final test!" 
...I think you might want to fight him back.

of HoloMud is laughing at your stupidity.  Not only were you warned
that this was a DeathTrap, but you OPENED A TRAPDOOR TO GET DOWN
HERE!!  Quit mudding right now!  Do not pass go, do not collect
your $$200.  Just hang it up and leave while you still have some
sense of decency left.  Of course if you come back, you must realize
the consequence.  Your mistake will be posted on the MOTD (which is
the message of the day).  You poor fool!

Desc          Hush, hush...a melody so sweet softly wafts toward you, surrounding you 
with a sound so beautiful, yet so gentle and quiet that you are able only to 
listen.  The music gently swirls around your head, lifting you high into the 
air.  Floating...floating...drifting gently among pillows of soft clouds.  
Steadily, steadily the music intensifies, lifting you higher and higher til 
you glide among constellations of light.  You soar and plunge through the 
heavens, rocketing toward a distant glowing sun.  

   Suddenly, a flare erupts near you, causing you to quickly change course.  
You warp quickly into another dimension, where the past and present flow 
into each other.  Ancient kings coronating future rulers.  Past empires as t
he foundation for future cities.  You wonder at these unbelievable scenes, 
marveling at such unseen sites--Suddenly cities and kings blur together, 
whirling like swirled paint into a pinpoint of darkness.  Everything around 
you vanishes into that point, until you are surrounded by nothingness.  

   Out of the nothing steps a being unlike any you have seen before.  
"Greetings my child," the being says.  It shows you the instrument it used 
to create what you just experienced.  The Staff of the Bards!  You had heard 
of such an instrument, but dismissed that as myth.  So it does exist!  You 
reach out to grab the instrument, but...the bard stops you.  "This gift I 
offer you if you are willing to learn," the bard says.  "Prove your worth 
of receiving such a fine gift."  The bard then awaits your reply.
