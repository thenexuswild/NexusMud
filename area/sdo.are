transparent obsidian on the surrounding four walls, floor, and ceiling.
You find that you are standing in the Nexus on the Orion
Outpost near the Planet K'vor. This gateway is used to travel to far off worlds.
Through modern science you can travel to many worlds in an instance with just a simple voice 
command.  To get a list of the locations you can travel to type "look gateway". To travel to one, you need only 
say "run <name of location>". Enjoy your travel!
To the north you see the Arch.

small table with lab equipment on it.  Isn't that the lab itself to the

Desc          Although you are walking in a fairly secluded room up above
Vuarq's, you can still hear the commotion from the bar below.  You 
see some large, comfy chairs here in bright neon colors, and some
half-finished drinks sit on the small tables next to the chairs.
A powerpad is also on the table, and you can use it to read
quest messages, or post one of your own.  To see the messages,
input "look at board".  To see a particular message, input "read
<message number>".  To post one, input "write <message title>". 
You may use this room as long as you like, but please be quiet.  To
the east is the HoloSuite, while down takes you back to Vuarq's.

the midst of great commotion as beings hustle to and fro, trying
to catch a shop before it closes or get to Vuarq's.  There are
specialty shops all around you, while Vuarq's is in the middle
of this level.  You are amazed at the many races of beings that 
frequent Orion Outpost, yet you see more K'vorans and 
Humans than other races.  There are some stairs leading up to the 
Transportation Level.  To the east is the Reading Room, while to the

an image of Dr. Wong appears before you.  He greets you
