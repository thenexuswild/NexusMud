Desc      Jeez....whoever decorated this room has no taste whatsoever... The colors 
seem designed to clash, and the plaid/striped/polkadotted curtains do NOT help.
You can smell the scent of stale herring guts.

Desc      Well, you have found both sources of the foul odor. There is about a week's
worth of uneaten food here that the cockroaches have gotten their grubby little
appendages on, and a thin man in sunglasses, wearing FAR too much "Brut" in here.
