Desc       Boy, is it *immense*. You find yourself unable to clearly describe it
further, because you are currently smashed between it and the wall just
so you can stand here, thusly blocked from a decent view of it.
Appalled by your insignificant presence, or possibly just as a side
effect of its odd faculty of continuous expansion, his ego seems to
be pushing you out of the room!

Desc       This friendly-looking creature peers at you inquisitively and waddles over.
You have a brief impression of a short, stout body covered entirely in grey
and blue hair, before a feeling of panic and foreboding comes over you.
Despite your fear, you feel an almost uncontrollable urge to hug the platypus.
How mind-boggling!  As the creature's arms close you, returning your hug,
your last thought is that you've lost your last chance to escape.  HEHE.

still there...  HEY WHERE DID IT GO??!!

Desc       As you stare into the cold eyes of this grand master of the martial arts, you
feel your soul being drained. You cringe in fear because inside the thin frame
of the warrior lurks an untamed beast ready to strike at any given time. All
those that have underestimated him would not be able to tell you about their
experience because they are all dead.

warm fire crackles in a large fireplace.  You hear the sound of music
mixing with the voices.  To the back of the room you see a massage parlor.
Over the fireplace hangs a large portrait of Itch, patron god of INC.  He
has a sly look on his face...

here, you wonder?  The sounds are about to drive you insane when you
detect one low reverberating voice continuously going "HEHE" through all
the other chatter.  You decide to explore, and off in a lone corner you
see this strange brown and blue "thing" waddling around.  What a complete
boggler!  Summoning up your courage, you move closer to the "thing" and
see that it has greyish-brown hair, blue webbed feet and a blue beak that
opens repeatedly to say "HEHE."  It's...it's...a platypus!!  Time to
flee...but PANIC! you can't escape and it seems the HEHEing platypus has
spotted you!  The little thing waddles over to you, makes a magical gesture
with its arm and suddenly, every time you open your mouth all you can say is
"HEHE."  You are now one of the morons/lunatics too...enjoy your stay in
the house of "HEHE."

Desc       As you enter the home of the Dragon clan, you immediately are overwhelmed
by the grandiose dimensions of the place.  Your eyes first notice the
fireplace on the north wall - a fire cheerfully burns, providing warmth
and light.  Mounted above the fireplace is a stuffed (what else?) head of
a dragon.  The east wall is adorned with various paintings, including one
of the members of the clan.  Underneath the painting rests a very plush
couch, and just to the right of it is a baby grand piano.  The west wall
is where the clan storage locker is.  
  Scattered around the room are chairs - any of which looks very inviting
to plop down on and rest up from your adventures.  To the north lies the exit
back out when you tire of resting and yearn to pick up your sword again.

Desc       	The room here is a complete mess.  The walls are mostly bare, though
at the far end there is a wide variety of paint and paneling on the wall.
You nearly trip over some small holes in the floor, which look like they were 
created by the explosion of some unstable object.  Strange monsters wander 
around the room, picking up objects that you have never seen before.  You 
wonder briefly why this room is not nearly as well decorated as the rest of 
the clan rooms, but then you realize that the OreOs are the builders of the 
mud, and to them the entire mud is their room.  This is just where they go 
for a little chaos.
	Behind a curtain is a beautifully lifelike painting of Infoteq, the
patron god of Builders.  He seems to be watching everything that happens in
this room...almost as if he was testing the objects and monsters...

from Mo's and Mookie's room next door. Suddenly you get a throbbing headache
from the loud thumping of rap music coming from Stace-o The Mighty Land Lord's
room. You think to yourself "What a hole!" but then you say, "Ahh, but it's
home."
