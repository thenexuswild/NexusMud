Desc          This large room can accomodate over 200 people.  A raised dias occupies the
northern end of this room, presumably where the Shogun sits when he is holding
councils of great importance.  Otherwise, he probably uses his receiving room.
The walls are decorated with paintings which depict man as being very minute
compared to nature.  There are three exits to the west, with the northerly one
leading into the southern end of the grand hall, the middle one leading into
the north end of the courtyard, and the southerly one leading to the south end
of the courtyard.  A door to the west leads into the western courtyard.

that the man who sits here is far above the rest of the people who live in the
lands of Nippon.  There is a small table here, with an ink stick, a grinding
stone, and a fine-haired brush set upon it.  the tatami which covers the floor
of the dias is a colorful map, showing the extent of the Empire.

Desc          This small and non-descript courtyard lies in the shadows of the palace
which surrounds it.  It serves as a guardpoint, so that only people with 
authorized access to the antechamber may pass.  You would hate to be the one
left guarding this lonely and boring spot.

Desc          The male servants of the palace are housed in this medium-sized room. Though
sparsely decorated, the room is far from uncomfortable, and spacious enough for
the number of people living here.  There are several tatami and pillows spread
out on the floor, though it is obvious that the men here fight for as much space
as possible when they have to go to sleep.  There is a sliding paper door to
the east which opens out into the hallway.

Desc          This huge stable is larger than the homes of most peasant families, yet the
only one who lives here is the Shogun's own personal mount.  The stable is kept
meticulously clean, and a groom is stays here almost half the day!  Only the 
best for the most important horse in the country!

Desc          This large field off the stable path looks like the perfect place to take a
nice long roll in the grass!  Well, it does if you are a horse.  The horses are
allowed to graze here daily, so as to give them an opportunity to stretch and
exercise.

Desc          This room is the main access to the tall walls of pure white stone which
defend the palace.  From these walls, the Shogun's soldiers may rain arrows
and other unpleasant objects down upon hapless invaders, with little fear of a
return voley.  Steps lead down into the gate house, and up to the watch tower.

view the main road on the palace grounds, and most of the south side of Showa.
There is a large horn here, used to warn castle inhabitants of invaders.

ExDesc     It is quiet large, pointing toward the palace.  Examining it closely though, 
you see that the reed is missing; thus, it probably won't work!

Desc          Due to the earthquake which caused the destruction of the steps, the Shogun
has set this large closet aside as his Consort's dressing room.  There is a
beatiful rosewood table against the north wall, and a mirror on the south wall.
