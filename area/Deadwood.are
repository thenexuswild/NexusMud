a money transaction. Through the teller cages you see a massive metal
door standing slightly ajar that you assume is a vault. There are two
uniformed security guards, each with a holstered .45 on their hip,
standing by the vault. By the way they look, you know only authorized
personnel are allowed in. There is a waist-high swinging door to the
west that leads to the teller cages.

tables. There is boisterous laughter and the general din of
conversation all around you. In the corner near a door leading west
is a man playing a well-worn, black piano. Several of the tables are
filled with stern-faced cowboys playing cards - their expressions not 
betraying their hand. Close to a few of the tables are large metal 
vase-type containers, which you guess can only be spittoons - *YUK*!!
   Many of the dancehall girls linger around the tables cheering the 
players. You see Miss Sassy, the owner of this lively place, overseeing
the saloon. A sign in red bold letters on the wall catches your 
attention. You notice some stairs here also. Behind the bar, you see 
rows of bottles framed by a long mirror on the wall. As you swagger up 
to the long counter, the bartender asks, "What'll it be partner?".

shade trees surrounding the pond help to keep it cool during the hot 
days. Remnants of homemade fishing poles lie upon the ground, and you 
see decomposing fishheads and guts as well. Someone has left their

here waiting to be used. But, by far, the most popular wood is pine - 
easy to work with and cheap to get. Wood chips and dust cover the floor
and lanterns provide the light. You see many finished coffins atop each
other, and others can be seen in various stages of completion.
