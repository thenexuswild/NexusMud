The desert to the north and south is lighter than to the west, with the sandy
dunes being replaced by shrubs and cacti. The desert stretching to the east
also shows signs of rainfall - off in the distance you think you see the arid
landscape yield to grasslands.

There are brush and cacti dotting the landscape here, and further to

what looks like a huge grassland stretching out in that direction, 
which extends to the east as well. The light desert continues to the

Desc       Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty feet 
across. The stones that form it are still visible through the grass that seems 
to have grown up through the cracks everywhere. Traveling along it has caused 
you to start wondering; who could have built this road? how long ago?  What 
great cities did it connect? The answers just have been lost to modern lore, or 
surely in your ravels you would have heard some rumor of this place.  The road 
marches on through the hills, flat, straight, north and south.

across. The stones that form it are still visible through the grass that seems 
to have grown up through the cracks everywhere. You are approaching the 
mountains now, for the hills are getting taller and the road is starting to 
climb, though it is as straight as ever. The clime is getting a bit colder with 
the elevation. You notice an overgrown path to the west through the hills, it
shows no signs of having been traveled in these times.

to have grown up through the cracks everywhere. At last you have reached the 
mountains. The ancient road does not stop upon reaching the base of the enormous rock face, however, but disappears into a gigantic tunnel, the mouth of which 
has a radius of at least thirty feet. It size permits the light to extend for some distance into the tunnel - you can see that the load continues as before.

been used for long. You are on top of a tall hill, one that gives an excellent 
view of the plains and the desert. Far to the north you see a glint of blue that can only be the ocean. It is there the road must have been headed. There is an 
area of scorched earth here that has withstood all the wind and rains, from an 
huge number of campfires kept by the watchmen who once stayed here. The winding 
path leads back down the hill to the east.

have been lookout used to view the world below. The mountains rise straight 
above you, the sheer rock face forming an impassable barrier to further 
travel in that direction. To the west you can see a fissure in the rock; one 
that is deep enough that you can't see how far it extends. You know better than 
to try to get there from here, though, as it would involve scaling the mountain 
going west for more than twenty feet, and you'd never make it. The steep trail 
heads back down the mountain here, giving you an exit.

recesses of this crack. You figure you can work your way up the fissure to

close to the north wall, as it arches out of sight quite quickly. What you can 
see of it appears to be moving. Very odd. From the blackness of whatever it is 
that is up there, you think it might be bats. Of course, that would mean there 
are lots of them. As this occurs to you, it also strikes you that it might be a 
good idea to leave. Like, now.

Desc       You've come to a place where the river must have been fed by two sources which 
merged into a single stream. The southern route was clearly the larger of the 
two sources, as the tunnel there is only slightly smaller than the one into 
which the two sources converge to the north. The other source looks like it 
probably was a minor tributary, as the hole through which it enters this tunnel 
is barely large enough to fit through. It leads up and to the west.

Desc       This is a narrow spot in a tunnel that was once the bed of an underground 
stream. The passage makes a turn here from heading east-west to going pretty 
much straight down into a narrow crack. Something seems to have made its home 
here in the years that have passed, as there are bits of broken junk and 
shattered bones strewn about the floor. You have a slightly uneasy feeling, and 
have a strong urge to leave, either to the west, or down.

Desc       This is the source for an underground channel. There is a stream extending up 
the mountains here at a prohibitive grade, disappearing into a crevice directly 
below you. There is room to stand here, and the protective mountain face to 
either side of you keeps the icy talons of the wind from ravishing you once 
more.

Desc       Brrrrrrrr. This water is cold. Fortunately, it's only up to your thighs so the 
force of the pull downstream is still possible to resist. You're having second 
thoughts about traveling this way, because you can see that to go much further 
along the streambed here you are going to need a set of gills.  Water almost 
completely fills the tunnel along which the stream is flowing to the east, and 
it looks like the tunnel drops further and the water rises higher as it 
continues. You can still get out of here by leaving up.

Desc       Well, now you've done it. Better hope you can breathe water, cause you can see 
that the last of the air pockets disappears as the stream continues to the east. Man this water is cold. And the flow is strong too - it's taking every ounce of 
your strength to avoid being swept along with the rushing current. You can still get out to the west, to the east the water flows out of sight down into the 
darkness.

Desc       Good thing you can breathe water, as the water has now completely filled the 
underground channel. The icy water here is really quite cold, and the force of 
the current to the east is irresistible. You can make out a small hole in the 
roof of the tunnel here, through which you might be able to fit. You can also 
exit west, back to the portion of the channel with air, or to the darkness 
visible to the east, towards which the stream is swiftly flowing.

Desc       This is the bottom of an underground lake. Fortunately, the water here isn't as cold as the stream, but it's still uncomfortable. The lake floor is covered 
with a sticky mud, which is reason enough for you to continue swimming rather 
walking along the bottom. There are a few blind fish darting about; they are 
more concentrated to the south and west. They don't seem to like your light 
source very much, and move away when you come close. There is a fairly strong 
current pulling you to the east. You can also exit up to the lake surface, west and south to other parts of the lake, and down into a small hole leading to 
unknown destinations.

current pulling you to the east, where the visibility is a little better. The 
lake extends to the south as well, and it seems like the water warms up a bit

fairly muddy, which makes it difficult to maintain your sense of direction.  It

lake floor. There are a variety of underwater life forms here, mostly blind, 
that shy away from your painfully bright light. There is a slow current here,

much interest in entering this hole. There seems to be a flow of warmer 
water from that direction, which might explain why the lake's relative warmth.

Desc           Perhaps coming in here wasn't such a good idea. The temperature of the water in what has turned out to be a small underwater cave is a few degrees warmer 
than the chillier water of the lake proper. Perhaps that is why some rather 
large and nasty predators have taken this to be their home. Unlike the lake 
bottom, the underwater cave is rocky, and along the floor you can make out a 
layer of bones whose depth isn't easily determinable. There is a crack in the 
south wall out of which the warmer water flows, but it is too small for passage. If you survive, you can exit to the north.

on the other side out of which warmer water is emitted more slowly. You could 
probably get into the smaller crack, but the force of the current out of the 
larger makes travel through it impossible. The current is pulling you to the

Desc           You are at the bottom of a deep chasm, at the exit mouth of what was once 
probably one of the major sources for the mighty river that cut it's way through the soft earth. The chasm walls tower above you to the east and west, while the 
river bed extends to the north and south. The sun tears into your skin, the heat here is blistering! Perhaps you should take cover in the tunnel to the east.
You can also go south along the dry river bed.

Desc          You are sweating a bit under your armor now, as the temperature in this dry 
river bed is excruciatingly hot. It isn't hard to see why, either, as the white 
sand along on the river bed reflects the sunlight back off the cliffs that rise 
above you to the east and west. The breeze you had noticed before has 
disappeared as mysteriously as it came, leaving the area in a sweltering calm. 
This place is even hot at night! You can exit north along the river bed.

Desc           Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty 
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the 
elements have not been able to abuse it as they have where it is exposed to the
open sky. You have entered the arching tunnel mouth, which towers above your 
head impressively. It is still possible to see here, from the light coming in 
through the tunnel entrance. The road continues straight and level into the
heart of the mountains; no end is visible from here, as it is shrouded in 
darkness a few hundred feet beyond your current position.

the gradual reduction of light from the entrance to nearly nothing - it is now 
only a small semi-circle of light in the distance to the north. At this point, 
only your light source allows you to see. The road, however, continues as 
before; straight, flat, and serviceable for travel.

were heading north, although it's hard to tell for sure. Clearly, whoever these 
people were, they have been dead for a very long time.

stale and unpleasant. It only becomes more so to the south, though it is better

Desc          Abruptly, the road ends here in a tremendous cave-in to the south. It isn't 
clear how long ago the earth shifted and the roof of the tunnel collapsed, but 
it is clear that no further travel to the south is possible this way. You spot
a few bones and pieces of broken equipment here, and the shadows your light 
casts  large stones among those that block your passage seem to dance and flicker evilly. You have a strong urge to flee.

Desc            Well, you've found an explanation for the broken bones. A party of well 
armed troglodytes have marked your travel down the road and have been waiting 
patiently for you to arrive. They seem to have come from a small hole in the 
west wall you hadn't noticed before, as it was partially hidden by one of the 
large rocks that has fallen from the ceiling.

Desc          You have entered a small, smelly cave. There are bits of junk scattered 
about the dirty floor, personal things of the cave's occupant - a large and 
particularly evil looking troglodyte. The conditions he is living in are 
pitiful, and you turn your nose in disgust at the remains of a rotted tunnel rat that he discards as you enter. Looks like he's found a more appetizing meal.

Desc           This cave is really nothing more than a slightly larger tunnel than most, 
but it serves as an outpost for several troglodyte watchmen, who don't seem to 
think much of your visit. They don't like your light very much. In fact, from
their behavior you might even think they don't like you!

Desc           You seem to have stumbled upon an outpost of the troglodytes that live in 
this region. In fact, from the sounds and glimpses to movement you see to the 
west, you might have stumbled upon a troglodytic settlement. There are several 
large troglodytes here will be glad to show you around. Well, they might be 
willing to at least carry bits of you around, after they're done taking you 
apart.

Desc          This cave is apparently home to a bunch of real slobs. Not surprisingly, it 
is adolescent troglodytes that live here. There are pieces of broken bone and 
little bits of metal and glass scattered about the floor, as well as the
"valuables" of the cave's residents. You can hear the sounds of metal hitting 
metal coming from the north, and there are also exits to the west and east.

Desc            This cave is clearly a practice area for troglodytes to hone their skills 
of maiming and killing. The cave wall is an impressive dark brown - dried blood 
from the less successful of those tutored here. Apparently they play-fight 
awfully rough. The broken weapons and scraps of armor lying about testify to 
this fact as well. There are exits to the south and west.

Desc           Mmm, you can smell some delicious tunnel rat stewing here that is 
quite apparently the cooking area for the troglodytes living around here.  There are a few pots and pans here, though they are barely recognizable as such. The 
small fire under the pot from which that yummy rat smell is being emitted is 
barely enough to see by, but you can detect some troglodyte matrons slaving over the cookery. They seem to think you'd make a nice addition to the meal they're 
preparing. There is an exit to the south, and you hear what might be the clatter of weapons coming from the east.

Desc           It's yet another troglodyte strongpoint. From the density of these things, 
you'd have to think the troglodyte people were constantly under attack. Who 
could be invading their homeland? You realize it's probably adventurers like
you they guard themselves against. The cave is large and has three exits, one 
each to the north, south, and east. There is a funny, slightly unpleasant smell 
coming from the north.

begining of the main troglodyte community, as they are quite numerous here.
From their reaction to you, you'd think they are of the opinion you are

donut, with an extremely large column in the center of the cavern. The
diameter of the column, you estimate, is probably about two-thirds of that of
the cave itself. It makes for a very strange tunnel-like effect, but it looks
natural though you have no idea what froce of nature might have caused it.
  This is where the troglodytes hone their weapons and repair their armor. YOu
receive looks from the many troglodytes working in here, they eye your armor
and weapons appreciatively.

Desc         This is the northeastern cave of a linked set of four caves, which could 
also be characterized as a single cave with an awfully big column in the center.
From what you can tell, the cave is shaped more or less like a big donut. In
this section of the cave, female troglodytes are working on extracting those
vital vitamins and minerals from recent kills, by crushing the bones into
powder which gets mixed into an occassional meal.  There are a couple of
young trogs running around here, annoying those working.  All this activity
ceases when you enter, and they turn to the task of defending their home.

Desc          This cave appears to be the nursery.  Normally, the troglodyte young and
their guardians are here, playing games and learning new skills.  The cave is 
entirely unlit normally, and the presence of your light source appears to be
the brightest thing some of the little  have ever seen. Again, it strikes
you that you might be trespassing.  There is a larger cave off to the south,
and there are also caverns to the north and west.

Desc          This is a smaller cave than any of the others in this area.  It appears
to be the hidden twin strongpoint to the one directly east of here, from 
which the cave you are currently in iis not clearly visible.  Orinarily, this
position would be occupied by troglodytes watching over the other strongpoint
to the east, preparing to reinforce them in case of any trouble.

Desc          You are in the female troglodyte sleeping quarters, as nice a place as you
think you've ever seen, for a cave.  It looks like the place has been cleaned
with a toothbrush, even the dirt on the cave floor looks clean.  The rocks
are shiney and they sparkle at you, hinting at worth in their glittering
cleanliness, even though you know they are without value.  There are ordinarily
several female troglodytes here in serious discussion.

Desc          This large cave is the sleeping quarters of most of the male troglodytes,
a fact that is evinced more than anything by the bad smell and the large mess. 
How so many creatures who don't believe in bathing could live together in one
room is beyond comprehension.  Perhaps troglodytes have no sense of smell. 
This place is such a mess, you imagine they must have bad vision, too, to 
tolerate it.  The cave is normally occupied by a few troglodyte soldiers,
catching a nap between guard duties.

Desc         The cave you are in resembles a tunnel more than anything, and might be
labeled as such if it weren't so wide.  In fact, though, you are in a cavern
with an extremely large column of natural stone in the middle, which blocks
the view of the other side of the cavern from your current position.  This
part of the cave is the practice area for adult troglodytes, as there are scraps
of metal and wood scattered about the floor in silent testimony to past rites
of supremacy that determine their clan chief. An iron grate leads out to a 
cemetary.

Desc          You are now in the northwest arc of a large, donut shaped cave.  This is
likely the place where the soldiers work out their strategy and formations,
as you can see a bunch of rocks set on a stone "table" (really just a large,
flat rock), ostensible the staging grounds for mock battles and strategic
plots by the troglodytes here for many a year, given how smooth the top has
been worn.  There are also several crude drawings on the wall, though what
they are of, it is hard to say for sure.

Desc          This is the chief's "private" cave.  Apparently being the leader of these
people has some privileges, at least.  The caves furnishing are only slightly
more ornate here than anywhere else, though, so apparently the job isn't exactly
loaded with perks.  The chief is here, talking with his top fighters about
prospects of battle.  They turn to you, knowing now the battle they had been
anticipating is already upon them.  There is an exit to the east.

Desc          This cave is apparently the place where the troglodyte chief receives his
guests.  There is a large case filled with trophies from past victories of
the clan.  Among the trophies, you spot a battered Golden Shield. the skull
of a cave fisher, with some dents and a big hole just over the right eye, a 
small crystal sphere, and dull grey helmet with a plume that was once probably
white.  The mementos here range from the unexpected to the astounding.  You
are impressed by the ability of such a seemingly limited people to have defeated
such a large and varied set of opponents.  You can exit north.

Desc          The end of the mountain train is evident to your west from here, the trail
drops steeply and the ground turns greener, as the elevation isn't sufficient
to maintain the ice and snow of the higher ground.  A freezing wind blows down
the mountains through which this trail winds, and it makes you shiver in your
boots.  The mountain trail leads to the south from here up and up again the
mountain heights.  You can also go west to more moderate climes.

Desc          The trail turns again here, as it makes its way up and around the peaks
that have started to appear around you in all directions.  Though the path
doesn't assault any actual peaks, you notice that the elevation here is 
significantly higher than it is to the north, and it rises even further as
it continues it's journey to the east, since it moves off the valley floor up
along the side of a mountain.  Up until now, the snow that has been adorning
the mountain was higher up, but you have come to the point where the trail winds
through the snow.  Still, it is compact enough to permit travel, though the
way is a bit slipperier.

Desc          It is bitterly cold here.  The snow on the path is about ankle deep here,
and it's fresh, which makes traveling on it a bit of a trial.  The path is now
making its way along a mountainside, rather than trying to slither between the
peaks at their bases.  As a result, to the south there is an impressive drop to
the valley floor far below.  Fortunately, the path is wide enough to afford to
afford easy travel without worrying about slipping to one's death below.  The
grade is quite steep going up to the east, though to the west the trail leaves
the mountainside on it's way down to warmer places.  An icy wind blows from the
southeast, chilling you to the bone

Desc         The trail curves along the side of a mountain here, leading to the west and
south, ever rising to the south, leading to the weat.  Across a valley far below
you, you can see lesser peaks to the north.  You are above them, and you can see
they are just below the constant cloudline that glooms menacingly on the trail
leading south into the mountain above you.  The snow is still shallow enough 
here for reasonable travel, though it is fresh, and your feet sink up to the top
of your ankles.  Unfortunately, it looks as if it only gets deeper to the south,
where the trail rises further.  The wind is strong here, and it claws at your
clothing, penetrating to make you long for warmer climes.

Desc         Your ears pop, and it is difficult to brormally here, as the elevation
makes for a scarcity in the oxygen in the atmosphere.  You hope to leave this
place soon, as the elements are starting to wear on you.  It is snowing lightly
here, and the fresh snow on the ground makes travel difficult, as each step is a
labor in which you submerge your feet into knee deep and extract them only to
plod on.  Adding to the unpleasantness is a wind that you are really starting to
resent, blowing down from the south.  Visibility is restricted here by the cloud
cover, so it is immpossible to tell how much further the trail rises before it
breaks through the worst part of the mountains.  You can go up to the south,
and down to the north.

Desc         The trail drops into a small crevice here, as it makes it's way up the side
of yet another immense peak.  You can't tell how far up you are for sure, but
given the practically waist deep snow and the difficulty you are having
breathing it is higher than humanoids were built to travel for very long.  The
nice thing about the crevice is that it prevents the wind from doing further
damage to you, for a while at least.  The snow here is on the heavy side; large
flakes now fall around you silently.  The crevice turns to the east, leading
ever upward, and to the north it returns to the lands below.

Desc         To say it is snowing here would be an understatement. It is snowing *HARD*,
and combined with the strong cold wind the weather here could almost be
characterized as a blizzard.  You have to bend over to present as little surface
as possible to the constant force of the wind.  The mountain train is now
covered in hip deep snow and distinguishable only because of the mountains
to the north and east and southwest prevent passage in those directions.  You
can barely breath, and the instant crystallization of what little air you expel
tells you that continued travel here may be a fatal mistake.  To the extent 
the trail is visible, it leads down the mountain to the west and up further
still to the north.

Desc         You are in a full force blizzard, travelling along a narrow pass near the
top of the peaks in a vast mountain range.  You can just see the outline of the
pinnacles of the mountain to your east and west, and the ground seems to have
entirely flattened out, though it is hard to be sure with the gale force wind
buffeting you about and blowing snow in your eyes.  It is nearly impossible to 
breath here, the air is so thin.  You are now practically swimming in snow
and the exertion is exhausting you.  The mountain leads further south, and to
the north where the trail descends.

Desc          The wind screams in your ears here, as you enter a narrow mountain pass at
the very apex of the mountain range.  From what little you can tell in the 
driving snow, the trail drops in elevation to the south, though it flattens
out to the north.  Unfortunately, the further south you go, the deeper the
snow gets.  Eventually, it reaches eye level, and you realize that further
passage in this direction is immpossible.  The prospects of making you way
to the north are not particularly attractive, but further travel to the south
is right out, since wading through snow above your head would certainly result
in a frozen, self-performed burial.

cliff apparently blocking further passage in that direction. 
The landscape here is dotted with brown brush and other dry
weather foliage, though as you look to the south things get 
a bit greener, probably the result of runoff from an 
extensive mountain range that has become visible to the 
southeast. From here, you can see the whitecaps standing 
starkly against the clear sky. The trail to the south looks 
like it's headed that way, as the trail has a pronounced 
rise in that direction. A side path to the southwest
branches out to a path you're certain you've traveled on

where men (certainly some kind of humanoid, from the shape 
of the bunks) would sleep and spend some of their free time. 
There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for

continue to the north, there is also an opening in the east

Desc           This area served as a checkpoint for those entering the 
outpost from the outside. There is an extremely large and 
imposing-looking gate to the east. In times of old it must 
have served to guard the outpost from any opposition forces. 
It shows no signs of damage, on this side, at least, so 
perhaps it was never needed to fulfill pose. It has 
a large, complicated  locking mechanism, which even the most 
competent thief would turn green trying to pick. There is a 
passage to the east, and the gate stands to the west, 
leading to unknown destinations.

rollers, and from what you can see in the cabinets that are
open, they are filled with linens and bandages. This room 
was once a medical facility, but a thick layer of dust has 
settled over everything as the ages passed, removing any 
sterility this room might have once had. Among the furniture 
here are several open storage cabinets, and a couple closed

it was a assembling grounds for the troops getting ready to 
go out to battle. As you hold your light aloft, you can 
barely see the roof where a large, broken sphere once 
provided light to the grounds. There are wide openings to 
the east and west, and narrower tunnels lead to the north

any of these exits lead.  The dust on the floor here is 
uneven - possibly this area has been disturbed by someone or 
something since it was vacated ages ago.

Desc           This room is filled with bunks, like the barracks, but 
there are no double bunks here, only singles. You also 
notice they are further spread apart than in the regular 
barracks, thus fueling your conclusion that it is officers 
who slept here. For each bunk there is a desk and mirror, 
though the mirrors are detectable only by the frames they 
were once housed in and the fragments still on the floor - 
they have all been broken. The desks hang open, some with 
their drawers extracted, which explains the wood splinters 
all over the floor. The officer's quarters continues to the 
east, and there is also an opening to a corridor in the 
south wall.

the north and west wall. You can't really tell for sure what 
the room to the north was used for, but it looks like it may 
have been some kind of barracks. The chamber to the west is 
clearly a bath house, though like everything else here, it

Desc          This room served as a bath house for the soldiers of this outpost.  There
are six open pits in the stone floor, each around four feet deep and six feet
in diameter, that served as tubs for those trying to rid themselves of dirt.
There are small channels cut into the floor, an offshoot from the main channel,
which extends from a small hole in the south wall, leads up to each of the six
pits.  Because all the tubs are currently dry, and look to have been so for
some time, you can see at the bottom of each pit there is a small opening as
well.  Ostensibly, water flowed through the channels, into the tubs, and 
drained out through the holes.  The engineering of this room impresses you
immensely.  There is only one exit, to the west.

of wire tied at varying heights between two tall, flexible wooden poles.  There
is also an area where the floor is covered by a strange flexible material,
which deforms and shrinks when you put weight on it.  Plus, there's a large,

Desc         This is the north end of a hallway.  The hall leads south as far as your
light source will show you.  The stone here is obviously cut - this is no
natural passage but the work of some intelligent species.  Given the size and
orthangonality of the doorways and dimensions of the passages, you estimate
that they were probably humanoid.  The are openings a little wider than 
that of a door in the east and west walls, in addition to the route south
along the hallway.  Peeking through the openings reveals both rooms to be
storage areas, though from here in the hall it is hard to tell what they 
hold.  You think you see crates.  There are sconce on the walls for torches,
but there are none in them now.

opening in the east wall leading into what looks like it might have once been
an armory, as your light casts shadows off the racks and hooks where weapons
once could have hung.  To the west are some stairs carved out of the solid 
rock.  They lead up.  The engineering required to manipulate the solid stone 
in this area so precisely impresses you.  Thls for

north.  It is apparently a storeroom, though it looks as if it has been unused
for some time.  There are crates lining the walls, some of which are broken
and have spilled their contents onto the floor.  Unfortunately, it looks
like whatever they once held was perishable, because all that is left now is
shards of broken glass and stains on the stone floor.  There are also some
wooden planks from broken barrels, along with a couple of barrels still intact,
lined up against the south wall.  There is a square opening in the east wall,
unlike the jagged holes to the north which lead back to the tunnels.

torn off completely.  There's no sign of it now.  Whatever other furniture
was here at one time has been stolen or smashed to pieces.  The only way out

visible bloodstains on the walls, floor, and furniture here.  The rusty red
color goes quite nicely with the black color of everything else in the room,
including the walls and all of the furniture.  This place really gives you
the creeps for some reason.  The black bed and dresser seem to have been
untouched by the passage of time, and there is a mirror atop the dresser that
is ,quite amazingly, unbroken.  Doubtless and artifact of this room's having
been sealed.  There is an exit through the door to the north.

hinges and capable of closing.  The room is sparsely furnished, though it looks 
like at one time it might have been rather nicely decorated.  What is left of
the furniture in here is pretty much destroyed.  What once might have been
a bed is now just a lot of broken wood and torn cloth scattered around the
floor.  The dresser is in slightly better shape, at least you can still
recognize how the pieces once fix together.  Everything in here is looking
pretty broken.  The exit is to the east.

for the officers to bathe in. They are both dried out now, 
though the channels in the floor through which the water 
used to run are still intact. A small hole in the north wall 
is the source of the channels in the floor that lead to the 
two now-empty pits. A small hole at the bottom of each 
provides drainage. There is a single exit, it is to the 
east.

the north.  It is apparently a storeroom, though it looks as if it has been
unused for sometime.  There are crates lining the walls, some of which are
broken and have spilled contents onto the floor.  Unfortunately, it looks like
whatever they once held was perishable, because all that is left now is shards
of broken glass and stains on the stone floor.  There are also some wooden
planks from broken barrels, along with a couple of barrels that are still
intact, lined up against the south wall.  There is a square opening in the
east wall, unlike the small jagged hole in the south that leads back to the
tunnels.

of late.  There are racks on the walls for weapons, bookshelves for magical
tomes, and a laboratory for the manufacture of healing potions and salves.
Just above the lab is a small altar to the gods.  There is a single bed, a
big wooden desk with a chair on rollers behind it, and also a big warchest,
now open, in which you can see an impressive array of hard won treasures.

tomes of magic incantations.  Nothing else appears to be of interest, yet
