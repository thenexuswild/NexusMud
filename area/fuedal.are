ExDesc     Welcome to Ishikawa, city of the Gods, the northern capital of Nippon, the
Empire of the Sun!  Remember, here, the Samurai's word is law, and any breach
of the law is punishable by death.
For more information, consult the following:

History:                  page 1
General layout:           page 2
Places to see:            page 3
While is Ishikawa:        page 4
General Rules to follow:  page 5

History:
   The great goddess Amaterasu came down to the earth a millenia ago, looking
to establish her primary temple.  Her search led her to the beautiful Ishikawa
River Basin, in the shadows of the Issiko mountains, at the edge of the Sea of
White Lillies.  Here, she caused a giant pillar to rise from the earth, where
she might rest and look out upon the Empire of her Children, the Nipponese.
   Several centuries ago, Prince Arishito chose Ishikawa as the capital of his
fief, and ordred the construction of Ishikawa castle on a hill at the western
edge of the small village.  With such Imperial prestige, the village blossomed
into a flourishing city.  However, as Imperial power declined, and political
power fell into the hands of the first  Taira  Shogun, the  city became a most
important strategic point along the coastal road.  The hereditary prince was
forced to move from the castle, and the Taira  Shogun's  most trusted daimyo
moved in.  Even after the fall of the Taira Shogunate, during the dark and
chaotic years of fragmentation, the heirs of the daimyo remained.
   Seven years ago, Arishikage, the dragon servant of Lord Tamicichi, came
and killed the Daimyo, subjecting the city under its own rule.  Tamikichi
sought to attain the long unheld title of Shogun.  However, he was opposed by
Ashikage Akihito, the man who would eventually reunify the great Empire and
become Shogun.  His greatest samurai, the unimatable Miyamoto Musashi, slew
the great Arishikage, and Takimichi fled.  Akihito made Ishikawa castle his
summer palace, and now spends much time here.

General Layout:
   Ishikawa City is located on the Ishikawa river delta, with the main part of
the city lying between the northern and middle branches.  To the north lie the
most fertile rice paddies in the Empire, which line the Great Coastal Road.
This road leads into the hinter lands where the subjugated Ainu barbarians
live.  To the west lies the great bamboo forest, which is supposedly haunted
by spirits.  To the south, the Great Coastal Road continues, heading toward the
central part of the Empire.  To the east is the Great Sea of White Lillies.
   Ishikawa itself is divided into many districts.  On the western side lies
the warrior-noble district, and within that, the Shogun's summer palace.  On
the east side is the great market square, where you can buy anything you can
imagine.  The northeastern section is very dangerous, and we do not recommend
an extended stay there.
   Consult the map for further details.

Places to see:
   Unfortunately, you will have to walk.
   BUT, it is well worth the trouble!  Some of the places of interest include:
The Pillar of Ameratasu:  A monument to the Great Goddess!
The Temple of Ameratasu:  her primary temple in the Empire!
The lighthouse:  provides a beautiful view of the Sea!
The Market place:  you can find just about anything!
The Library:  Mages of the world come here to do research!
The Palace:  You probably cannot get in, but it is nice to look at.
The Grand Hotel:  The best service in the world!
The Imperial Kilns:  See where the finest porcelein in the world is made!
The Imperial Museum:  See the best of Japanese culture! 
AND MUCH, MUCH MORE!
Consult the map for exact locations and other details.

While in Ishikawa:
   It is rumored that Miyamoto Musashi still lives, and seeks to share his vast
knowledge of swordsmanship with others.  Try exploring the haunted forest.
   The mystic swordsmith Masamura also lives somewhere in the haunted forest.
   Find the secrets of the celestial kingdom!  Look for clues throughout the
city.
   It is rumored that a secret society's training grounds lies some where in
the vicinity of the city.
   AND MUCH, MUCH MORE!
General rules to follow:
   Show respect to the samurai:  be sure to bow a lot.
   No spitting on the street.  
   Obey your superiors.
   Leave generous donations at the temples and shrines of the city.

a large restuarant invite you to come in and eat.  To the west, a large bar is
open, waiting to serve you the strongest, sweetest alcoholic beverages.

rows upon rows of merchants, and the other customers trying to evaluate the

Desc          The southern end of Ishikawa's market place is home to some of the finest
clothes stores in the world.  The newest, most fashionalbe styles of clothes
can be found here, at very reasonable prices.  In addition, merchants who do
not own a store have spread their wares out on the ground, hoping that they
can undercut the prices of the store owners.  Looking to the north, you see
the center of the market place, where the pillar of Ameratasu reaches toward
the heavens.

Desc          The north gate is held in place between two stone towers which rise before
you.  Much time, money, and labor was put into the building of these defenses,
a sad monument and reminder of a much more violent age. To the south, Ishikawa

is a visitor's center, while the unpassable remains of Kysushu Road, passing
through the burnt-out district, lies to the east.

a bamboo forest glade, which in some ways diminishes the attractiveness of the
house itself, yet enhances the beauty of the whole.  Offering a fine view of
the Ishikawa River, the compound represents the apogee of Japanese geomancy and

landscape painting.  Overlooking the moat, the park provides a spectacular view
of the Shogun's palace, which, set on it's hill, rises well over a hundred feet
abotve you.  To the north is the entrance to the park, while there is a rickety
old bridge leading onto the palace grounds to the south.

Desc          Working by one of the main docks in Ishikawa, the harbor master is supposed
to keep track of all ships coming and leaving the city.  His office is fairly
large, decorated by woodblock paintings and fine furniture.  A large desk lies
at the west end of the room, and is covered with a mountain of papers.

Desc          These are the northernmost docks in the city, reaching some thirty feet
into the vast ocean.  However, this dock is perhaps the most unsafe, having
been seriously damaged in the great fire.  Very few ships are anchored here.

Desc          This quiet little shop is home to a small Japanese man, a skilled bowyer who
provides most of the bows, arrows and accesories for the Shogun.  He also makes
money on the side by selling bows to other citizens of the Empire.  The shop is
meticulously kept clean.  Several unstrung bows lie on the counter and on the
walls.

Desc         The Japanese are very picky about the way they smell, and thus make use of a
refreshing bath at least once, maybe ten times a day.  Therefore, the public
bath house is a very popular spot, especially for those who do not yet have
their own tubs.  It is very warm and wet here, probably from all the hot water
around.  Several wooden tubs are lined up, each large enough for three people
to relax in.  Servants hurry about, trying to change water as people leave.
Reflecting upon the situation, you realize that this place has become a social
gathering place.

some strange, water-run machinery which helps size and cut wood.  Saw dust lies
everywhere.  The incessant sound of sawing is at its loudest here.  An exit to
the east leads to the entrance of the mill, anohter  exit to the north leads to
a store room, and a loading dock lies to the west.

Desc         The plot of the play is hard to follow, even more so now that you have joined
in.  Apparently, the forces of good are gathering here for mutual protection.
To the south, you see the forces of evil plotting against the good in the rear
stage.  The supreme good is represented by a beautiful young woman, a symbol of
virtue and power, who has lost her beloved to the clutches on an evil demon.
She is being advised by her guardian, a spirit.
   To the west and five feet below you, you see the lower western seating. To
the east and five feet below you, you see the lower eastern seating.  Finally,
down to the north is the common seating.

around you seems a little more distant, and not as unnerving.  The supreme evil
is represented by a horrifying demon, who has used its evil powers to drive the
Koomote's lover insane.  To the north is the front stage, where you can see the
forces of good confering.  To the south is a purple curtain.  Below you is the
chorus, which provides the lovely sound effects and music for the drama.

going on.  Perhaps the forces of good will overcome?  The backstage is littered

Desc          As in most societies, men will be men.  Several men gather here, trying to
prove their worth by making an easy yen.  It is dimly lit here, though you can
pretty much see what is happening.  Several tables are laid out, where people
are playing card games or the Chinese game Mahjong.  In addition to the door
which leads back out onto Shitoku Road, an exit to the north leads into a back
room  It is very loud here, as people argue over bets and the like.

and thus, everyone seems to notice your arrival.  Despite being separated

Desc          You are standing in one of the many parks in Ishikawa.  However, this park
is unlike any you have ever seen.  The only objects here are stones and sand.
Yet, it is very quiet and relaxing here, as a cool breeze brushes across your
face.  The uniqueness of the park makes this a perfect place to meditate.

dangerous East Akikage Road, being lined with trees and bushes. To the south,
you see several workers trying to renovate and old compound.  To the north,
a wide, tree-lined boulevard leads to the estate of one of the Empire's most
