the pieces. When Ouroba refused, the cardinal ordered his shop closed and Ouroba
was imprisoned inside.  Perhaps Aramis or Porthos can tell you more.'

with you.  When Richelieu had the sword broken into 6 pieces he gave 3 of them
to some of the city's prominent citizens, I know not which ones though.  
Richelieu is rumored to keep the tip of the sword on his body at all times and 
will pay handsomely anyone who can destroy it.  Alas I know no more, perhaps
Porthos or Athos can tell you more.'

his right side.  'Or perhaps you've come to find out what I know about the
pieces of D'Artagnan's sword.  I've heard that one of the pieces was thrown into
the river which lies under the palace.  Rouchefort supposedly was entrusted
with another piece until someone who can destroy them is discovered.  
Unfortunately that is all that I know, perhaps Aramis or Athos can tell 
more.'

the outside of his home.

elegant dwelling with a flowery looking mailbox. Painted on the mailbox
is the name 'Julia' in pink letters. To the south you see a rather simple
looking dwelling, with one of the shutters just barely hanging on its
hinge. The tattered welcome mat reads 'Destant's abode.' From the symbols
on the doorway, you perceive his occupation to be a guildmaster.

Desc       You have finally arrived at the headquarters of the famous Musketeers! 
You had expected a glorious palace, but the buiilding really is quite 
simplistic in design. Torches line the walls of the lobby causing a 
glowing effect in the room. You look up and see colorful banners and 
draperies hanging from the ceiling. You get the feeling that the 
Musketeers probably don't concern themselves with the visual looks of their 
home. You see a pair of Musketeers arm-wrestling over in the corner, 
while another is reading by the firelight.

run-down in is in a state of disrepair. Tattered cloths cover the 
remaining pews in the building, and cobwebs are clearly visible in all 
parts of the building. You look up, and see high, arching ceilings that 
make the room appear larger than it actually is.

Desc       This is the sleeping area for the guardsmen of the palace.  It has the
appearance of barracks, but the men have personalized their surroundings
a bit.  There is limited furniture, but you see a couple of hand-crafted
chairs in the corners of the room.

about itself. This is probably the abode of the presiding Cardinal, whose
penchant for his own image is clearly shown in his decor.

replica sits to its left. A long red carpet is laid from the door to the 
pedestal on which the throne sits. Servants bustle about making sure that
everything is perfect for their king and queen.

Desc       This is where the owners and their guests come when they just want to relax
a little.  There are assorted gaming devices scattered about the room. A
large dartboard hangs on the wall, with lots of little holes surrounding it.
Apparently the owner's aim leaves something to be desired.

Desc       This is a tiny cramped room with just a stone slab hanging from the wall
for the prisoners to rest on. A hole in the bars is just big enough to
allow a plate or a cup to pass through it, when the prisoners are fed
their rations of bread and water.

steamy. You see water draining down through a large metal grate in the 
floor. You can hear the rushing of water far in the distance...I wonder 
where that water's going?

around here somewhere?  This staircase doesn't look very safe. The boards
have been eaten away by all the moisture down here. Be careful if you
decide to use it. There is a door here that may lead to the water 
source...and then again, it might not.

about to burst! Peering through the water, you can see the water flowing 
through a small opening just barely big enough for a person to fit 
through. You can feel the strong currents of the water pulling you into 
the opening. Your only way out appears to be to backtrack as fast as you can.
But, that means swimming against the current...good luck!

eyes can barely make out a ray of light streaming from the surface. 
FINALLY, a way out of here! Better get up to the surface as fast as you can!
Staying here gets you a free tour of Davy Jones' locker, so to speak.
