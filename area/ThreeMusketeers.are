was imprisoned inside.  Perhaps Aramis or Porthos can tell you more.'

to some of the city's prominent citizens, I know not which ones though.

will pay handsomely anyone who can destroy it.  Alas I know no more, perhaps
Porthos or Athos can tell you more.'

pieces of D'Artagnan's sword.  I've heard that one of the pieces was thrown into
the river which lies under the palace.  Rouchefort supposedly was entrusted
with another piece until someone who can destroy them is discovered.

is the name 'Julia' in pink letters. To the south you see a rather simple

You had expected a glorious palace, but the buiilding really is quite 
simplistic in design. Torches line the walls of the lobby causing a 
glowing effect in the room. You look up and see colorful banners and 
draperies hanging from the ceiling. You get the feeling that the 
Musketeers probably don't concern themselves with the visual looks of their 
home. You see a pair of Musketeers arm-wrestling over in the corner, 
while another is reading by the firelight.

Desc      You dive below the surface and observe all the activity going on in the
river. You can make out lots of junk that people have dumped here. You
detect a disturbance in the water flowing around you. Seems like there
might be something moving around down here. You better be on your guard. 
You can feel the water around you drawing you toward the north.

Desc      You are swimming deeper and deeper into the recesses of this cavern. The 
water seems to be much darker in this area. As you peer through the water, 
you can still feel the mysterious disturbance in the water flow. You get the 
feeling you are about to discover the 'mystery.' Hope you live to tell 
about it...you seem to be running out of air! Your water-breathing 
ability must not be working well.

Desc      You are swimming deeper and deeper into the recesses of this cavern. The
passage has widened a bit, so it's a little easier going now. The water
seems to be much darker in this area. As you peer through the water, you
can still feel the mysterious disturbance in the water flow. You get the
feeling you are about to discover the 'mystery.' Hope you live to tell
about it. You feel your lungs constricting as they are running out of air.
Your water-breathing abilities are definitely acting strangely!

water still clouds your vision somewhat.As you peer through the water, you
can still feel the mysterious disturbance in the water flow. You get the
feeling you are about to discover the 'mystery.' The pressure in your 
head begins to build as your muscles demand oxygen in order to move. Too 
bad you can't breathe in the water here. Things are beginning to look 
pretty serious.

Desc      It seems like you've been swimming forever! Your lungs are seriously 
about to burst! Peering through the water, you can see the water flowing 
through a small opening just barely big enough for a person to fit 
through. You can feel the strong currents of the water pulling you into 
the opening. Your only way out appears to be to backtrack as fast as you can.
But, that means swimming against the current...good luck!

hole VERY soon, your whole body will become waterlogged. Your irritated 
eyes can barely make out a ray of light streaming from the surface. 
FINALLY, a way out of here! Better get up to the surface as fast as you can!
Staying here gets you a free tour of Davy Jones' locker, so to speak.

the fatal mistake of misjudging your air supply. Your lungs burst from 
the pressure, and your lifeless body floats to the surface. The powerful 
currents of the river carry your body to places unknown. Yet another life 
is lost to the majestic Seine River.
