ExDesc     Congratulations Sir Knight for finding the invisible rock.
Make sure the rock is closed so no one can follow.
 
You must descend into the darkness and fight three skeletal figures.
I have tried so many times and was unsuccessful. Due to my greed for the
treasure, I refused to tell anyone about this place to help me.
If you have enough help, you can do it.
 
One thing I remembered about the pit, every time I went down, I loss more and
more confidence in myself and I thought I would be unable to get the treasure.
Don't let this happen to you.
 
Good luck Sir Knight
                                          -Sir Accolon of Gaul

ExDesc     Welcome to the Combat Field.
If you wish to combat, come east my friend. Many eager knights await to slay
you.
If you kill the first knight, and you continue moving east, you will have
a difficult time killing the next knight. The further you move east, the
more experience these knights are.
 
If you do not wish to fight by blade, we have many powerful mages in the
northeast part of this forest. No magic will be tolerated here.
 
Good luck Sir Knight and remember...never yield your honor.

  To whoever finds this.
  There is a lost treasure I have devoted my life to seeking out.
  It probably is likely that if you are reading this, I have died and I
  wish to pass the secrets onto you.
  Somewhere within Camelot, I can't really describe how to find it, there
  is a huge bouling on top of a small hill. It is invisible and
  can only be seen if you know what you are looking for. Open up the boulder
  and I have left further instructions how to proceed prior to my death.
  Good luck Sir Knight...and may God be with you.

ExDesc     There is feared an dishonorable knight. He is the Knight Invisible.
He approaches up to anyone and slashes at them without warning.
He must be stopped. He has stolen much armour and much gold.
It is estimated that his armour brings him powerful armour class and he has
looted as much 35K in gold. That will be the reward for killing him.
If you successfully have killed the evil knight, shout it so all can hear
and live in peace.
Good luck Sir Knight...and may God bring speed to you.

ExDesc     Welcome to Carteloise Castle.
King Evelake, leader of this castle is a direct descendant of King David
of Israel.
 
He possesses the holy Grail, one which Christ drank of at his Last 
Supper; And the Spear of Tears, one which was used by a Roman Soldier 
to pierce the side of Christ at his crucifixion.
 
The Grail has eternal wine and the Spear is only used for healing...if 
it is used as an act of violence, the beholder will die.
 
King Evelake is a hospitable man and is also without sight.
If you wish for food or board, for a small fee you can come in and we 
will suit you right away.

water comes cascading down into a large pool. The turns into a small
river leading to the west. It is pretty dark down here... To the north a
very neonish blue field is suspended in mid-air. Throughout your vast amount
of experiences with "very neonish blue fields", you could guess that this is
either a portal to somewhere, or a particle field that would kill you. You can
faintly hear the din of adventurers.

is oscillating at totally random intervals (like lightning). The marsh is
drying up. You see a structure off to the east.
