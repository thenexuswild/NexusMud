Desc          The Ace of Pentacles augurs the possibility of material achievement,
because the raw energy for this kind of work is now available to the 
individual.  Often money is made available through a legacy or some other
source, coupled with the ingenuity and persistance to utilize these
resources effectively.

Desc          The Two of Pentacles heralds a time when money and energy are likely
to be available for new projects that might lead to a rewarding future;
but the individual must be willing to put his resources to work, taking
tasks and using capital, rather than hoarding and saving at a time when
new opportunities arise.  Thus the Two of Pentacles is likely to be a 
welcome card to those who know how to 'play' with money.

Desc          The Three of Pentacles heralds a time of early success in some material
endeavour.  A project may earn profits, or a creative venture such as a
book may show early success in the market.  But as with all the Threes,
this is not a final resolution, but a stage which will hopefully lead,
through hard work and difficulty, to a more permanent reward.

Desc          The Four of Pentacles warns about an attitude of holding too tightly
to things which are bound up with one's sense of self-value.  The fear 
of loss may mean no loss, but it also means no gain, for there is a
stagnation of creative energy which can eventually not only block funds
but also block self-expression.

Desc          The Five of Pentacles augurs a period of financial difficulty or loss.
This may be accompanied by a loss of faith in oneself, and it is important
to try to respond to the challenge not only by letting go if necessary and
preparing to begin again, but also by considering where one's own nature
might have led to or exacerbated the problem.  A reorientation is now
possible not only on a financial level but also on an inner one.

Desc          The Eight of Pentacles augurs a period when the individual plays the
role of the hard-working apprentice who is struggling to acquire a new 
skill.  This card can suggest a talent which the individual has recently
discovered and which is worthy of development and effort, or it can imply
that a hobby could be developed into a profession.  The individual may
experience great enthusiasm and interest in some new field of work which
requires him or her to become a hard-working trainee, often at a time of 
life when one 'ought' to be firmly established.

Desc          The Nine of Pentacles augurs a period where one may be justifiably
pleased with oneself and with what one has been able to achieve.  There
is often a strong sense of solid identity, a feeling of one's unique
abilities and the worth of one's life.  This is not inflated, but based
on a realistic appreciation of one's skills.  This card reflects the
solitary and self-sufficient enjoyment of good things, which does not
depend upon anyone else's agreement or validation to provide pleasure
and deep satisifaction.

book or painting which one knows will live on and offer its value

together of energy which can eventually be used for building things in
the world and for fulfilling the needs of the body.  Sometimes money
becomes available in small sums, which need to be saved and nurtured 
rather than thrown away as insignificant.  Sometimes the individual takes
up a new hobby which may later develop into a profession with time and
careful work; or he or she may begin to care for the body and take more
interest in sensual pleasure and fulfilment.  The message here, as with
all the Pages, is that care, gentleness, and time are needed to bring
the potential to fruition.

individual to develop that dimension of the personality which is comfortably
and firmly anchored in the ordinary tasks of living.  The Knight of 
Pentacles may enter one's life as an industrious, humble, gentle, hard-
working young man, perhaps lacking in imagination but rich in the qualities
of reliability and gentleness.  But if such a person enters one's sphere,
it may be seen as an opportunity to learn more about this side of oneself
through the catalyst of another.

the value of the body, and the importance of those pleasures which pre-
serve and enrich life.  The individual may also be called upon to learn
to sustain and preserve material resources, holding conditions stable
and secure and husbanding money and energy.  The Queen of Pentacles may
one's life as a strong, sensual woman, self-sufficient and hard-working
yet generous and willing to indulge herself and others if it suits her
purposes.  But if such a woman enters one's life, it suggests that
these qualities are trying to emerge from within oneself.

tact, diplomacy, and wit rather than strong-armed bullying tactics to 
achieve one's ends.  This may leave an uncomfortable feeling of falseness,
but life may require it.

~
Desc          The Eight of Swords heralds a situation where the individual is unable
to act because of his or her fear of the consequences.  A decision is
necessary, but either choice will lead to trouble.  There is a dawning
realization that one has created the dilemma oneself, for there is
usually a long past of avoidance, duplicity, blindness, and fear of
confrontation, often to 'avoid hurting' someone, which lies behind
the present impasse.  It is important to face honestly one's own part
in the problem.

be a tendency to start petty quarrels and to be irritable and difficult.
But these things reflect the emergence of new ideas and true independent
thinking--often in one who has been accustomed to accepting the views
of others.

Desc          When the Knight of Swords appears in a spread, it is time for the
individual to be prepared for sudden changes which break apart the
ordinary patterns of life.  These changes may be inaugurated by an
individual coming into one's life who possesses the quicksilver, 
fascinating, and disruptive qualities of the Dioscuri, or it may take
the form of a new idea or vision which erupts from within oneself and
which throws ordinary life into disorder for a time.  Thus, whether
the Knight of Swords appears from without or within, his gift is the 
ability to move with changes, and the turbulence which he brings may
ultimately lead to a broader vision of life.

unswaying to an immovable faith in high ideals.  These ideals may be
noble and lofty, and help to improve consciousness and the quality of
life.  But they may also reject life, and be a defense against the
fear of being human and therefore vulnerable to hurt.  The individual
needs to see where he or she might create problems through demanding
superhuman perfection of others or oneself.  If the Queen of Swords
enters one's life as a strong, idealistic, aloof woman, it may be seen
as a catalyst through which one discovers this aspect of oneself.

himself or herself.  This may often manifest as restlessness at work, 
a vague feeling of dissatisfaction not yet strong enough to motivate
a change, and a hint or glimpse that one might be able to expand one's
life in some way.  The initial fantasies which accompany such rest-
lessness do not have the uprushing power of the Ace of Wands, and may
ultimately turn out to be impractical or impossible.  Yet it is
important to take them seriously, for they are the harbingers of a 
stronger source of inspiration, and need to be nurtured rather than 
stamped upon as though such restlessness were merely a 'bad phase'
rather than a herald.

embodied in the figure of Bellerophon.  Often of a divinatory level, the
Knight of Wands manifests as a change of residence because the individual
suddenly feels too cramped by his or her environment and seeks broader 
and greener pastures.  Sometimes the Knight of Wands will enter one's
life in the form of a charming, exciting, and rather unreliable young
man, full of new ideas, who inspires but who must be taken with the
proverbial grain of salt lest he lead one into a bad fall.  But if such
an individual enters one's sphere, it should be seen as an augury that
these qualities are trying to emerge from within oneself.

Desc          When the King of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the 
individual to encounter that dimension of the personality which 
initiates new ideas and sells them to others, thereby generating
change in one's own life and in the immediate environment.  It is
the spirit of leadership, the belief that one has a better idea
which is worth promulgating and working to make manifest.  This
dimension of life may appear in the form of a fiery, impulsive
individual entering one's sphere, someone who infects others with
the power of his ideas.  But if such a person enters one's life, it 
is not by chance, but is rather an augury of one's own need for 
development.

Desc          The Four of Cups augurs a time of dissatisfaction, boredom and
depression within a relationship.  There is a feeling of being let
down or cheated, although the one who does the cheating is usually
oneself because of one's unreal expectations.  This dissatisfaction
can lead to long-standing, unexpressed resentment, or it can lead to
looking more deeply at the relationship, a harder path because previous
assumptions and fantasies will then be challenged.

has solidified, and although the past may seem beautiful and irrevocably
lost, something of its promise emerges, tempered and strengthened, into
the present.  This card implies nostalgia about the past, but with a
difference: the past can lead to the future, and the dream is experienced
as still possible, even near achievement.

Desc          When the Queen of Cups appears in a spread, it is time for the
individual to encounter the deep, unknowable, paradoxical world of
feeling in himself or herself.  The Queen of Cups may enter one's 
life as a mysterious, hypnotic woman, not necessarily overtly 
seductive yet strangely disturbing, and a catalyst for the emergence
of deep feelings and fantasies which have previously been hidden from
awareness.  She may appear as a beloved or as a rival, but either
way such an encounter is not mere chance.  It is rather an augury for
the emergence of these soul qualities within the individual.  For the
woman who is unaware of the Helen in herself and identifies with the
maternal or practical sides of feminity, the Queen of Cups implies
that it is time to meet her, even if the catalyst is the 'other woman.'
For the man who is unaware of the depths of his own soul, and bases his 
reality on rational thought and concrete facts, the Queen of Cups
heralds a deepening and development of the inner life, whether or not
the catalyst is an actual woman.

Desc          When the King of Cups appears in a spread, it is time for the
individual to experience this ambivalent side of himself or herself--
the gifted counsellor and healer who can empathize with and help 
others, yet who cannot quite trust life enough to take its course.  It
is characteristic that many of those in the helping professions choose
such a vocation because they have been wounded through personal 
relationships, often those with the parents, and thus they form
relationships where they remain ultimately in control and cannot be
that deeply hurt again.  Although this kind of dynamic may contribute
a great deal to others, one cheats oneself.  If the King of Cups
enters the individual's life in the form of a person who embodies
these qualities, then this may be taken as an indication that it is
time to meet this dimension of oneself.

complexion drives a bronze war-chariot.  The war-god Ares is dressed in
bronze armour, bronze helmet and a blood-red tunic.  At his hip is a 
bronze shield, and at his side is balanced a large spear.  He grips the
reins of two horses, one black and one white, which pull in opposite 
directions before him.  The dusty road on which he travels winds into a 
reddish, desert-like landscape, while the sky lowers with an impending storm.

   The card of the Chariot appearing in a spread augurs conflict and
struggle which can result in a stronger personality.  One may come
face to face not only with aggression in others, but with one's own
competitive and aggressive drives.  This conflict cannot be avoided,
but needs to be faced with strength and containment.

helmet.  His hands are open to receive the gifts offered by the tiny
human figures who kneel before him.  One gives him a golden crown, 
another a pile of coins.  The third, a child, hands him a flower.
Behind the dark god Hades a leaden river flows.  On the near side of the 
river the earth is cracked and barren.  On the far shore, the land slowly 
brightens and turns green beneath a rising sun.

   This card implies that something must come to an end.  Whether or not 
this experience is painful depends upon the person's capacity to accept 
and recognize the necessity of endings.  The card of Death can augur an 
opportunity for a new life, if one can let go of the old one.

music of the pipes which he holds in his left hand.  In his right, the
god Pan grasps two lengths of chain, each attached to a collar around
the neck of a naked human figure.  The figures--a man and a woman--wear
tiny horns like those of the Satyr.  Although their hands and feet are
free to dance, they are held by their chains of fear and fascination
for the music.  Around them loom the darks walls of a cave.

   This card implies the necessity of a confrontation with all that is
shadowy, shameful and base in the personality.  One must free one's self
by gaining knowledge and honest, humble acceptance of Pan, for then one 
can release the creative power which is held in chains by one's own panic
and self-disgust.  Thus one comes to the heart of the labyrinth and faces 
one's own darkness in the essential darkness of one's body, in order to
become what one always was--merely natural.

stands in a field of ripening barley.  Demeter, the Earth Mother, wears a 
gown woven of many different plants, and hemmed with leafy boughs.  Around
her neck is a necklace of twelve precious stones.  She is crowned with a
diadem of castles and towers.  Behind her, in a background of fertile fields,
water flows into a pool.

   The appearance of the Empress in a spread suggests the onset of a more
earthy phase of life.  A marriage or the birth of a child might occur; or
the birth of a creative child, an artistic offspring, for this too requires
the patience and nurturing of the Great Mother.  Through this card we enter
the realm of the body and the instincts, as a place of both peace and 
stagnation, life-giving and life-suffocating.

Desc          A mature man with broad, muscular shoulders and chest is sitting here.
His rich, flowing hair and beard are vivid auburn, and his eyes are a 
clear sky-blue.  He faces us seated on a golden throne at the top of a
mountain.  His robe is purple bordered with gold, and on his head is a 
golden crown.  In his right hand he holds three lightning bolts; in his
left rests the globe of the world.  An eagle perches on his shoulder.
Behind him stretches a backdrop of snow-capped peaks.

   Zeus, the Emperor, augurs a confrontation with the issue of the father
principle in both its positive and negative forms.  We are challenged to
make something manifest, to concretize a creative idea, to build something
in the world, to found a business perhaps, or to establish the structure
of a home and family.  We are asked to take a standpoint, to become
effective and powerful, to formulate our ideas and ethics.  We are also
asked to consider where the creative young king has become the rigid, 
oppressive tyrant, and where our idealogies are interfering with life and
growth.  One learns to confront worldly life with one's own resources,
alone, according to ethics which one must develop for oneself.

~
Desc          A wild youth, dressed in ragged animal skins of different coulours,
dances in ecstatic abandonment at the edge of a precipice.  He wears a 
wreathe of vine leaves in his chestnut hair, and bears little horns,
like those of a goat, on his brow.  Dionysos' eyes are raised to the dawn
breaking in the distance, where the sun can just be seen above the horizon.
Around him lies a formidable barren landscape of brown and grey rocks. 
To his left, hidden in the shadows of the receding night, is the mouth of 
the cave from which he has emerged.  Above it, on a bare branch, perches
an eagle.

   Dionysos, the Fool, augurs the advent of a new chapter of life when he
appears in a spread.  A risk of some kind is required, a willingness to
jump out into the unknown.  The Fool is ambiguous just as Dionysos is,
for we cannot know whether we will enter the Fool's perception of the divine
or end up merely looking foolish.  In this way, amidst ambiguity and
excitement and fear, begins the great journey of life portrayed by the
Major Arcana of the tarot m042.

Desc          A mature man with brown hair and beard is portrayed upside down here.
Although he is shackled in a tortuous position, nearly naked, to the
bare face of a cliff, Prometheus still wears a serene expression on his
face.  Behind him looms a dark landscape of craggy rocks, while a setting
sun casts a bloody glow across his body and illumines his head.  Above
him, an eagle approaches.

   Prometheus, the Hanged Man, augurs the need for a voluntary sacrifice
for the purpose of acquiring something of greater value.  This might be
the sacrifice of an external thing which has previously provided security,
in the hope that some potential can be given room to develop.  Or it can
be the sacrifice of a cherished attitude, such as intellectual superiority,
or unforgiving hatred, or a stubborn pursuit of some unobtainable fantasy.

Desc          Portrayed is an old man with a grey beard, shrouded in grey robes with
his face half-hidden by a cowl.  In his right hand he carries a lamp which
burns with a bright golden light.  In his left hand he wields a scythe.  
A crow perches on his shoulder.  Behind him a cold, misty landscape of
grey mountains bleeds into an oppressive grey sky.

   Cronos, the Hermit, augurs a time of aloneness or withdrawal from the
extraverted activities of life, so that the wisdom of patience may be
acquired.  There is an opportunity to build solid foundations if one is
willing to wait.  Thus one arrives at maturity, having developed a mind 
and a heart, a firm sense of identity and finally a deep respect for one's
own limitations in the great passage of the round of time.

Desc          Portrayed is a strange figure, a Centaur, with the torso, arms and head
of a man and the body of a horse.  His long brown hair and beard and his
benign, mature face suggest a priest or a teacher.  In his left hand he
holds a scroll containing written wisdom.  His right hand is held up in an
ancient sign of blessing.  To either side of him is a stone pillar.  Behind
him can be seen the rough rock of the cave which is both his home and his
temple.  Light streams down upon his crowned head from a circular opening
in the roof of the cave.

   Chiron, the Hierophant, implies when he appears in a spread that the
individual will begin to actively seek answers of a philosophical kind.
This may emerge as the study of a particular philosophy or system of belief,
or as a deep commitment to a quest for meaning in life.  The Hierophant
may appear in the form of an analyst, psychotherapist, priest or spiritual
mentor in outside life to whom we turn for comfort and help.  One thus
emerges from one's discovery of the underworld and the hidden powers of
the unconscious seeking answers to the enigma of oneself and the meaning
of one's life.

is a golden crown.  In her right hand she holds a pomegranate, split open
to show its multitude of seeds.  In her left hand a bunch of white

she stands is a pillar; the left one is black, the right one white.  
Behind her, at the top of the staircase, a doorway opens out on to the
rich green landscape which appears in the card of the Empress.

   The appearance of Persephone, the High Priestess, in a spread augurs 
the heightening of the powers of intuition, and implies that there will
be an encounter of some kind with the hidden inner world which Persephone
rules.  The individual may be drawn inexplicably to this world through an
interest in the occult or the esoteric, or through the effects of a power-
ful dream or the uncanny sense that 'something' is at work in one's life.

Desc          Portrayed is a young man with curling black hair, dressed in a white
tunic and a blood-red travelling cloak.  On his head is a winged helmet,
and his feet are shod in winged sandals.  In his right hand he holds the 
caduceus, the staff of magic entwined with two snakes.  On either side
of him, dimly visible, are two columns, one black and one white.  The 
stairs on which he stands ascend to a doorway through which can be
glimpsed a rich green landscape over which the sun is just rising.  Before
him, several carved coffins lie, and from these sarcophagi the dead are
rising, reaching out to him as they shrug off their burial shrouds.

   When Hermes, the card of Judgement, appears in a spread, augurs a time
when the rewards of past efforts appear.  This is a period of summing-up,
of a realization of what we have been doing and where we ourselves have 
created the future which now awaits us.  It is an ambiguous card, for it
can also imply a disturbing confrontation with all our own evasions and
self-betrayals.  The reward is not always a pleasant one.  Whatever 
occurs to the individual in terms of experiences, the card of Judgement
heralds the end of a chapter in life.  But unlike the card of Death, it
does not imply mourning.  Rather, it is a clear perception to the extent
to which we have been able to be true to ourselves.

Desc          Portrayed is a severly beautiful young woman, dressed in silver
helmet and battle armour, seated on a silver throne.  In her right hand
she holds an upright sword.  In her left she holds a pair of scales. 
Her pale hair and white robes echo the purity of the two white columns 
and portico which frame her.  Beneath her feet is a floor patterned of
black and white marble.  An owl perches on her left shoulder.

   Athena, the card of Justice, appearing in a spread implies the need
for balanced thought and impartial decision-making.  But like Athena's
sword, this card can be double-edged.  There are spheres of life where 
Athena's cool reflection is too chilly, too idealistic, and too destructive
to the warmth of a personal relationship.  Her sword can cut the heart
with general truths which are inappropriate for a particular situation.
Thus Justice is, like all the Major Arcana, an ambivalent figure.

shepherd's garb and holding a crook in his right hand.  In his left hand
Paris holds a golden apple.  Three women parade themselves before him, for 
this is a beauty contest, and the golden apple will be awarded to the winner.
Hera, on the left, is regal and mature, with vivid auburn hair and blue
eyes, robed in imperial purple and wearing a golden diadem.  She offers
the young man the globe of the world.  Aphrodite, in the center, is young,
seductive and black-haired.  Her diaphanous rose-coloured robe reveals 
more than it conceals.  She offers a golden cup.  Athena, on the right, is
cool and chaste, dressed in full battle armour; her pale hair is half-
hidden by a warrior's helmet.  She offers a sword.  Behind the four figures
stretches an undulating landscape of lush green hills.

   The card of the Lovers when it appears in a spread augurs the necessity
of a choice of some kind, usually in love.  Sometimes this means a love
triangle, but it can also mean the problem of too hasty a marriage, or a
choice between love and a career or some creative activity.  This card
implies the necessity of looking carefully at the implications of one's
choices, rather than being driven blindly, thereby inaugurating, like
Paris, a great conflagration.

short white tunic and a deep red travelling cloak.  With his left hand
he points upward toward heaven.  With the right he gestures at a flat
rock which lies before him at the center of the convergence of roads.  
On the rock four objects are assembled: a chalice, a sword, a flaming
wand or caduceus entwined by two snakes, and a pentacle.  Behind him can
be seen a barren landscape of brown and grey rocks--a continuation of
the landscape which was in the card of the Fool.  Two branches of the
road vanish in the rocky distance.

   Hermes, the Magician, points to potential skills and creative 
abilities which have not yet manifested.  He may appear as an upsurge
of energy and an intuition of exciting new opportunities.  He presages
insight and an awareness of unexplored possibilities.

bright star within which can be seen a female figure in glowing white robes.

Star, too, can be ambivalent, and can warn against blind hope without the
necessary action to build upon it, the card of the Star is an augury of
promise, an altogether welcome experience for one who has passed through
the collapse of everything which one believed to be of value in one's life.

lion loom the rocky walls of a dark cave.  Through the mouth of the cave

pride is desirable.  Courage, strength, and self-discipline are necessary
to battle with the situation.  Through such an experience we can come in

the hero, who can subdue it.

Desc          Portrayed is a stone edifice built on a high rock overlooking the
sea.  From the depths of the water a powerful, menacing figure emerges,
crowned with gold, brown hair streaming with seaweed, with a fish's
tail that can be seen between the angry waves.  Poseidon points his
trident at the building, which is struck by a flash of lightning and
cracks open.  The sea boils and the sky is black and ominous, lit by
stormy red flashes.

   The card of the Tower appearing in a spread augurs the breaking down
of existing forms.  This card, like the cards of Death and the Devil,
depends a great deal upon the attitude of the individual in terms of
how difficult or painful it is to deal with.  Obviously it is more
creative to ask oneself where one is constricted or bound by a false
persona or image, because a willing effort to break through this pretense
can spare a great deal of anguish.  But it seems that the Tower will
fall anyway, whether we are willing or unwilling, not because some
malicious external fate decrees it, but because something within the
individual has reached boiling point and can no longer live within such
confines.

Long       The Major Arcana Card 'The Wheel of Fortune' is here.
~
Desc          Portrayed are three women seated within a dark cave.  The first is 
young, and spins thread from a golden spindle.  The second is handsome
and mature, and measures a length of the thread between her hands.  The
third is old, and holds a pair of shears.  In the center between them is
a golden wheel, around which four small human figures can be seen in
different positons.  Through the mouth of the cave a rich green landscape
is visible.

   The Wheel of Fortune augurs a sudden change of fortune.  This may be
'good' or 'bad', but whichever way the Wheel turns it brings growth and 
a new phase of life.  We cannot predict what will come to meet us--or
rather, what we will turn to meet.  But behind these changes stand the
Moirai, an image of the center within.

Long       The Major Arcana Card 'The World' is here.
~
Desc          Portrayed is a golden serpent coiled in the shape of an egg, eating
its own tail.  Within its circumference a strange figure dances, half
male and half female, winged, crowned with laurel-leaves, and holding
in each hand a golden staff.  Around the egg-shape of the serpent can
be seen, rising from the clouds, a cup, a sword, a flaming wand, and a
golden pentacle.

   The card of the World when it appears in a spread augurs a time of 
achievement and integration.  This is a period of triumph at the
successful conclusion of a matter, or the reaching of a goal which has
been worked hard for.  But this peak is merely a glimpse of something 
mysterious and elusive, and the dancing Hermaphroditus becomes the foetus
who eventually emerges from the cave as the Fool.  Thus the great cycle
of the Major Arcana ends where it begins, for we might start with
Hermaphroditus as the unborn potential of the personality which ultimately
leads to the birth of the Fool.  And so the circle, like the World Snake,
is complete.

Desc          Standing inside a small chamber, you set out a fair-sized square of 
pure silk cloth in preparation for the warding ritual.  Reciting some 
incantations, you invoke the powers of the four elements--Earth, Air, 
Fire, and Water--and create a magic circle of protection around you.  
The circle serves as a bridge between worlds, and while you stand 
inside the protective area, you find yourself outside of time in a 
place not of earth.  You can see a sign with gold lettering here as 
you look around the protective area.  The bridge lies in the center of 
the four elements, each of which you have invoked and now lie in all 
the cardinal directions from you.  Each path of the elements represents
one of the suits of the Minor Arcana from the Tarot and also a mythical
journey as well.  Each path can also lead to riches or uncertain death.  
Be wary, young seeker of knowledge.

ExDesc        Welcome to the Tarot!  This area has been based on _The Mythic Tarot_
written by Juliet Sharman-Burke and Liz Greene.  The cards were 
illustrated by Tricia Newell.  _The Mythic Tarot_ is different from the 
traditional Rider Waite deck in that it uses figures from Greek Mythology
to illustrate the meanings of the cards.
 
   The area has been set up this way:  the Minor Arcana (the suit cards)
are on the lower level and fan out from this point in all of the cardinal
directions:
            The Earthen Path of Pentacles  --  North
            The Windy Path of Swords       --  East
            The Fiery Path of Wands        --  South
            The Watery Path of Cups        --  West
 
   After completing a run through one of the suits, you will have access 
to one of the four celtic crosses on the upper level where the Major 
Arcana cards lie.  Each Major Arcana card is able to load in any of the 
four celtic crosses or it might not even load at all.  The mobs are hard, 
but the riches and items they carry are worth it.  Good luck!

Desc          In the distance a landscape of fertile green hills open out onto a bay,
while close to you are crags draped in vines richly hung with ripening
grapes.  You stand before Poseidon, a fertility god, ruler of the seas,
lakes, rivers, and surface of the earth itself.  He is swarthy and
powerfully built with long curling brown hair and a fish's tail.  He rises
out of the depths of the sea and bears aloft a single golden pentacle.

Desc          From the bay you walk toward rolling green hills.  You see Daedalus, a
swarthy, brown-haired man, wearing an ochre-coloured tunic and a brown
leather apron, in his workshop.  Before him stands his work-table, 
supported by two golden pentacles.  On either side of him on a wooden 
trellis cluster vines heavy with grapes.  In his left hand Daedalus holds 
an axe, which he has just invented.  In his right hand he holds a saw, 
also his invention. Before him on the table are spread the tools of his 
trade.

again see Daedalus.  He is standing on a raised platform, still clothed 
in his ochre tunic and leather apron.  Three Athenians stand before him, 
dressed in subtle but rich robes.  Each offers him a golden pentacle.  
Around the four men are vines with grapes hung on a trellis.

Daedulus is clutching four golden pentacles tightly in his arms.  He
stares angrily at the young boy who is busy at the work-table -- his
nephew Talos, clothed in a pale green tunic, brown-haired and dark-
complexioned. Talos concentrates on a beautiful golden ornament which he 
is in the process of completing.  Green hills can be seen in the distance
against a clear sky.

night from the city where only a short time before he had achieved such
acclaim.  On a hill behind him stands his workshop, its trellis adorned
with vines and displaying five golden pentacles -- the success which
Daedalus must now leave behind him.  The road on which he travels leads
toward a barren landscape of brown hills.  In the black sky a thin
waning moon can be seen.

his knees in homage and hands clasped in a gesture of supplication before
a king.  Seated on a golden throne is King Minos of Crete -- a mature man
with black hair and beard and a swarthy complexion.  King Minos is robed
in regal purple and wears a golden crown.  In his hands he holds six
golden pentacles, offering them to Daedalus in a promise of future 
patronage.  Behind the kneeling craftsman and the enthroned king can be 
seen the walls of Minos' palace, decorated with painted friezes of bull-
dancers and borders of grape-laden vines.

painted column upon which his hand rests possessively, are six golden
pentacles.  To his left stands Queen Pasiphae, Minos' wife, clothed in
purple robes and wearing a golden crown on her long brown hair.  She
wears an expression of anguish and desperation on her face, and offers
the craftsman a single golden pentacle.  Behind her can be seen the head
and shoulders of a white bull.

palace in Sicily.  On either side of him, richly laden vines clamber up
wooden posts.  On the ground at the craftsman's feet lie seven golden
pentacles, all in an unfinished state and awaiting future work.  On the
wooden table before him lies a single golden pentacle, around which he

folden in a posture of satisfaction, a self-congratulatory smile on his
face.  He has discarded his tunic and leather apron, and is now clothed
in a rich ochre-colored gown trimmed with gold.  On his head rests a
laurel wreath.  On either side of him, richly laden vines climb up a
wooden trellis, while in the distance can be seen green mountains and
a calm blue sea.  Beside the craftsman, piled on the ground, are nine
golden pentacles.

Celeus of Eleusis, stands in a field where the new green growth of 
different varieties of vegetables, flowers, and herbs is just showing 
above the ploughed furrows of rich dark soil.  He holds a golden pentacle
gently in both hands.

Desc          Standing in rolling pastures dotted with sheep and an olive grove with
beehives, you see a young man with dark brown hair.  Aristaeus, called
'Guardian of the Flocks', is mounted on a stocky brown horse.  He is
dressed in a lime-green tunic and brown leather armour, and wears a brown
leather helmet.  In his right hand he holds a golden pentacle; in his 
left, a sheaf of wheat.  Above him is a brilliant blue sky.

Desc          In a landscape of ripe green and gold pastures in which a herd of 
cattle can be seen grazing, you see a beautiful woman with rich dark 
brown hair and brown eyes.  Queen Omphale wears a sensuously draped 
russet robe and a golden crown.  She is seated on a golden throne whose
arms are engraved with the heads of bulls.  In her right hand she holds 
a golden pentacle; in her left, a bunch of purple grapes.

Desc          You stand before a swarthy man with dark brown hair and beard, solidly
built, and obviously contented with his powerful worldly position.  King
Midas is seated on a golden throne whose arms are engraved with the heads
of goats.  Behind him rises a fortified castle, built of stone and draped
with vines.  In front of the castle his menials and attendants stand ready
to serve him.  In his hands he holds one golden pentacle, while beneath 
his feet lies a heap of golden coins -- tiny pentacles, his accumulation 
of worldly wealth.  He is richly but tastefully robed in gold brocade, and
wears a golden crown.  On the grass beside him, a brown goat grazes.

Desc          You have entered a scene of great conflict.  Orestes, a fair-haired 
youth dressed in a grey tunic, is standing as though paralyzed with his 
eyes tightly closed, and his hands pressed over his ears.  On the left 
stands his mother, Queen Clytemnestra, golden-haired and golden-crowned,
dressed in a pale lilac gown.  She holds a sword with its point directly 
before the young prince, and stares angrily over his head at her husband,
King Agamemnon, fair-haired with a blond beard, dressed in a sky-blue 
tunic and full battle armour.  He likewise holds a sword with its point 
directly before Orestes.  Behind them can be seen mountain peaks, and a 
darkening sky with ominous clouds.

Desc          Under dark skies you see King Agamemnon slaughtered in his bath.  The 
dead body of the king lies slackly in the water.  On the left, Aegisthus,
black-haired and black-bearded and robed in dark grey, pierces the king's
heart with a sword.  Another sword stands upright, its point buried in the
inert body.  On the right stands Clytemnestra, also piercing her husband's
heart with a sword.  Beyond the marble portico can be seen a black, 
brooding sky lowering over mountain peaks.

Desc          After the shocking scene before, this place seems much more peaceful.
Orestes is in exile in Phocis, yet he sits peacefully on the ground,
contemplating four swords which lie in a pattern before him.  Behind him 
can be seen a pale, quiet sky with little puffs of cloud, and a vista of 
snow-clad peaks.

Orestes, seated on the ground, faces the god Apollo, who has appeared to
tell him of his fate and his obligation -- to avenge his father's death.  
Apollo stands on the right and points sternly at the five swords which he
holds in his right hand.

Desc          Travelling at sea toward the city of Argos, we see Orestes standing 
in a dignified posture in a shallow boat.  He is wrapped in a pale mauve 
cloak, and he stares across the water toward the city which can be seen 
in the distance.  Six swords stand upright, their points embedded in the
hull of the boat.  In the foreground the waters are turbulent, and storm-
clouds can be seen in the sky.  But as Orestes approaches his city, the 
water can be seen to be calmer, and the sky above the city is clear.

Desc          In the middle of the night, Orestes, shrouded and hooded in his cloak,
stealthily creeps into the palace at Argos.  In his arms he carries seven
swords.  The street is dark, and the palace doorway is a black and 
unwelcoming opening.  In the distance, beyond the palace, can be seen a 
thin crescent moon shining in a black sky over the mountain peaks.

mountain peaks.  Orestes is in a fearful posture, his hands up to fend 
off his doom.  A ring of eight swords surrounds him, points embedded in 
the ground.  To his left stands Apollo, looking stern and angry.  To his 
right crouch the three Furies, robed in black, with white, ugly faces, 
snake-hair, and leathery bat-wings.

up a dark black sky.  The goddess Athena stands calmly and holds in her 
right hand an upright sword.  To her right crouch the three Furies, their 
menace contained within the ring of nine swords.  To her left, Orestes 
lies unconscious on the ground, nearly spent.

holds a silver sword.  Below him can be seen a grey mountainous landscape.

silver helmets over their fair hair.  Castor and Polydeuces, also called 
the Dioscuri, or the Warrior Twins, each hold a silver sword, and both are
mounted on the back of a single grey horse.  The horse is agitated, its 
front legs outstretched as though about to take off in flight, and the 
twins hold their swords aloft as though ready for battle.  Above the horse
and riders the grey sky is turbulent, with scudding clouds.

poised before he sets out on his journey to reclaim his inheritance.  
Chiron is dimly visible in the darkness of the cave.  Jason, clothed 
in a scarlet tunic, grips two flaming wands firmly in his hands.

Desc          As you follow Jason on his journey, you now notice that he has newly
arrived at the city of Iolkos.  He wears only one sandal, having lost the
other in crossing the river, thereby confirming the oracle which has
prophesied his advent.  He stands triumphantly, holding in his right hand
three flaming wands.  At his feet kneels the usurper, King Pelias,
black-haired and black-bearded, dressed in royal purple, and offering with
apparent humility the golden crown which he has unlawfully stolen.

Desc          You have chanced upon a celebration as Jason and his shipmates rejoice
after building the great ship Argo which will carry them on their voyage 
to Colchis to find the Golden Fleece.  The ship, decked with scarlet sails
bearing the emblem of a golden sunburst, waits on the tide.  Around the
scarlet-clad figure of Jason stand five of his heroic companions:  
Heracles, wearing his lion-skin and bearing a flaming wand; Theseus, King 
of Athens, crowned with gold and robed in crimson and bearing a flaming 
wand; Castor and Polydeuces, the Warrior Twins, both clad in silver 
armour and each bearing a flaming wand; and Orpheus the Singer, clad in 
a blue robe and holding his lyre.

covered in greenish scales, which guards the Golden Fleece.  The dragon
belches fire from its mouth while it clutches the precious Fleece in its 
claws.  Jason battles it with two flaming wands.  Beside him stands his 
lover and helper, the sorceress Medea, daughter of King Aeetes of Colchis
in whose possession the Fleece has lain.  She is beautiful and black-
haired, garbed in a flame-coloured gown, and carries three flaming wands.

thrown on turbulent waves.  You see Jason and his Argonauts final 
struggle before they reach their goal:  the passage through the Clashing 
Rocks.  In the distance the city of Iolkos can be seen, with nine flaming
wands beckoning on the shore.  Around the city the sea is calm.  The ship
Argo passes with tattered sails between the threatening rocks, not yet 
safely out the other side.  Around the ship a storm rages, and the sea is
rough.

Desc          After such a struggle at sea, it seems Jason would feel triumphant, 
but as it appears, he is not.  He is sitting wearily before the beached
wreck of the Argo.  He has returned trium to Iolkos, and he is robed
in kingly scarlet robes and wearing a golden crown.  The Golden Fleece 
lies at his feet.  He is bowed down by the heavy weight of the ten 
flaming wands which lie across his back and shoulders.

orange tunic and has curling auburn hair.  He carries a flaming wand

where the same maiden you saw in distress earlier is now dressed in a

of white lilies.  Eros wears his bow and a quiver of golden arrows and 
hovers quietly behind the young bride.  Three water nymphs dance in a 
circle around the couple and arise from the sea, each bearing a golden
cup in celebration of the marriage.

Desc          Once again it is nightfall, and you have chanced upon the aftermath of
Psyche's betrayal of Eros.  Having sworn a promise not to look at his 
face, Psyche had doubts after her sisters had stirred her fears and lit a 
lamp to see his sleeping face.  You can now see her standing distraught
before the empty nuptial couch, the lamp in one hand, the other hand 
reaching in desperation toward the departing figure of Eros which can be
glimpsed disappearing behind the marble columns of their beautiful palace.
In the foreground, four cups lie overturned, their contents spilled over 
the floor. A fifth cup remains standing, still intact, beside them.

Desc          As you walk along the seashore, you stumble on the rocky beach which 
rises into a rocky ledge.  There you see Psyche seated on the ledge and 
behind her a calm sea and calm skies can be seen.  In her left hand she
holds a golden cup, into which she pensively stares.  In her right hand 
she holds the rather bedraggled remains of her bridal bouquet of white 
lilies.  Around her on the rocky ledge stand five more golden cups.

Desc          It is the same rocky ledge, but time has passed, and the sky is 
getting cloudy.  Aphrodite now stands before Psyche and confronts her
with the tasks she must perform in order to win Eros, Aphrodite's son, 
back.  Psyche kneels on a rock before the goddess, acknowledging the 
direignty in all matters of love.  Aphrodite, rising out of 
the water, points to seven golden cups which float on the clouds 
before her.

Desc          You have walked further inland, and you can barely see the moonlight
flickering off of the ocean waves at this point.  You notice a dark 
pathway leading into the ground.  Psyche is performing the final task 
Aphrodite has given her:  the journey into the underworld to bring back
a pot of Persephone's beauty cream.  Psyche, empty-handed, descends the 
steps into Hades, her face set in sadness and resignation because she 
realizes that she will probably not survive the journey.  Behind her,
abandoned, stand eight neatly stacked golden cups.

Desc          Standing on the shore, you can see rock rising from the sea.  It is
daylight, and apparently a celebration is taking place on the rock.  
Psyche had been rescued from the darkness of the underworld and has been
reunited with Eros.  Psyche and Eros stand face to face embracing, 
garlanded with flowers, on the rock.  Each holds a golden cup.  Beside 
them Aphrodite stands benignly, raising a cup in blessing on their union.
Below them are six golden cups carefully stacked in celebration of the 
restored lovers.

Psyche and Eros are here, holding hands.  Psyche no longer wears a 
virginal hite gown; she is now clothed in shimmering gold, and onshoulders, like her husband, bears a pair of golden wings.  You are 
watching the immortalizing of Psyche to divine status so that she may
enter the world of the gods with her husband.  Before them stand ten
golden cups neatly stacked.

pool of water.  A young boy of around twelve years old with black hair 
and wearing a pale lilac tunic kneels at the edge of the deep blue pool.
On the ground beside the pool stands a golden cup, into which Narcissus 
peers ardently, for he is studying the reflection of his own face and is
struck by its beauty. Around him grow clumps of irises and narcissi, 
budding, not yet in bloom.

ocean in the distance beneath a pale blue sky.  Here you see a pale-
skinned, beautiful young man with black hair and soulful eyes mounted on
an elegant white horse.  He is dressed in a violet tunic and silver fish-
scale armour, and wears a silver helmet crowned with a silver fish's tail.
He leads his horse gracefully across a bubbling stream where fish leap 
from the water.  In one hand Perseus the Knight holds a golden cup.

rich black hair and wearing a blue-green gown and a golden crown.  She is 
seated on a golden throne whose arms are engraved with golden snakes.  
Helen of Troy's robes trail into the blue pool at her feet.  In one hand
she holds a golden apple; in the other, a golden cup into which she peers
with a look of profound concentration.

him, beyond the promontory of land on which his throne stands, a turbulent

this card comes as a surprise to the seeker, who may not have been aware 
of an unconscious motivation which needs to be brought into awareness.  We
do not always acthings for the reasons we think, and the card

Desc          Called the Views of Others, the card in position eight describes the 
image which those around us--friends and family--hold of our situation 
and ourselves.  The card which appears in this position will usually 
imply what kind of response to our situation we can expect from others, 
and also what we ourselves have been unconsciously doing to project such 
an image to the world outside.  Often an individual who is going through
problems of one kindother does not receive the understanding and 
sympathy from friends and loved ones that he or she hopes for, and the 
card in position eight can often tell us why not; for this is the view 
the world has of us, and it may contradict the way we feel as easily as 
it may honestly reflect our situation.

situation, inner and outer, which is generating conflict and obstruction
in the immediate present.  It is the thing which 'crosses' the seeker, 
and indicates the apparent nthe problem.  However, the Crossing
Card is not necessarily negative in meaning, but simply represents the 
situation which is generating the conflict and stirring up matters.  In 
a sense, it prevents the Significator from fully expressing itself, and
causes blockage in life.

behind the apparent surface situation reflected by the Crowning Card.  
What is at the base is really what is at the root of the psyche, and often
this card comes as a surprise to the seeker, who may not have been aware 
of an unconscious motivation which needs to be brought into awareness.  We
do not always act or feel things for the reasons we think, and the card 
which appears at the Base of the Matter will often contradict the apparent
reason for our dilemma at the time of consulting the cards.

Desc          Called the Crossing Card, the card in position two describes that
situation, inner and outer, which is generating conflict and 
obstruction in the immediate present.  It is the thing which 'crosses'
the seeker, and indicates the apparent nature of the problem.  However,
the Crossing Card is not necessarily negative in meaning, but simply
represents the situation which is generating the conflict and stirring 
up matters.  In a sense, it prevents the Significator from fully 
expressing itself, and causes blockage in life.

something is what appears in full view on top; and thus the card which 
appears here reflects what is out on the surface and immediately 
apparent in the seeker's life.

Desc          Called the Base of the Matter, the card in position four describes the
inner and outer situation, drive, instinct or aspiration which is really
behind the apparent surface situation reflected by the Crowning Card.  
What is at the base is really what is at the root of the psyche, and 
often this card comes as a surprise to the seeker, who may not have been 
aware of an unconscious motivation which needs to be brougho 
awareness.  We do not always act or feel things for the reasons we think,
and the card which appears at the Base of the Matter will often contradict
the apparent reason for our dilemma at the time of consulting the cards.

the past it had been important, perhaps representing a set of values 
which the individual held in high esteem; but now it has lost its potency,
and the seeker needs to be able to let go of whatever this card represents
before the new future developments can be integrated creatively into life.

Desc          Called the Views of Others, the card in position eight describes the
image which those around us--friends and family--hold of our situation 
and ourselves.  The card which appears in this position will usually 
imply what kind of response to our situation we can expect from others, 
and also what we ourselves have been unconsciously doing to project such 
an image to the world outside.  Often an individual who is going through 
problems of one kind or another does not receive the understanding and 
sympathy from friends and loved ones that he or she hopes for, and the 
card in position eight can often tell us why not; for this is the view 
the world has of us, and it may contradict the way we feel as easily as 
it may honestly reflect our situation.

Desc          Called the Crossing Card, the card in position two describes that
situation, inner and outer, which is generating conflict and 
obstruction in the immediaesent.  It is the thing which 'crosses' 
the seeker, and indicates the apparent nature of the problem.  However, 
the Crossing Card is not necessarily negative in meaning, but simply 
represents the situation which is generating the conflict and stirring 
up matters.  In a sense, it prevents the Significator from fully 
expressing itself, and causes blockage in life.

Desc          Called the Base of the Matter, the card in position four describes 
the inner and outer situation, drive, instinct or aspiration which is 
really behind the apparent surface situation reflected by the Crowning
Card.  What is at the base is really what is at the root of the psyche, 
and often this card comes as a surprise to the seeker, who may not have
been aware of an unconscious motivation which needs to be brought into 
awareness.  We do not always act or feel things for the reasons we think,
and the card which appears at the Base of the Matter will often contradict
the apparent reason for our dilemma at the time of consulting the cards.

the past it had been important, perhaps representing a set of values 
which the individual held in high esteem; but now it has lost its potency,
and the seeker needs to be able to let go of whatever this card represents
before the new future developments can be integrated creatively into life.

Desc          Called the Views of Others, the card in position eight describes the 
image which those around us--friends and family--hold of our situation 
and ourselves.  The card which appears in this position will usually 
imply what kind of response to our situation we can expect from others, 
and also what we ourselves have been unconsciously doing to project such 
an image to the world outside.  Often an individual who is going through 
problems of one kind or another does not receive the understanding and 
sympathy from friends and loved ones that he or she hopes for, and the 
card in position eight can often tell us why not; for this is the view 
the world has of us, and it may contradict the way we feel as easily as
it may honestly reflect our situation.
