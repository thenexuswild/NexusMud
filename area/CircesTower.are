Desc       This small black pig is desperately, and mostly unsuccessfully,
rooting around in the grassy soil for food.  You have heard that Circe
sometimes turns unlucky sailors who intrude upon her isle into pigs, and in
horror, you wonder if this could be one of your unfortunate acquaintances.

muscled body lift you into the skies.  Unfortunately, Pegasus seems very
unhappy to see you, and shies away from you as you approach it.  Your ride will

her natural talents with hard work and constant experimentation, and
was rewarded when the figures on the tapestries she wove seemed to
come to life.  Unfortunately, her skills eventually only brought her the
dubious distinction of being kidnaped by Circe and placed here to work.

colored frescoes on the walls of the Knossos palace in Crete.  Her
frescoes were distinguished by their harmonious blends of colors and their
realistic renditions of sea life.  Because Circe's mother was born from the
sea, Circe found these frescoes pleasing, and thus she brought this
woman here and gave her the elixir of immortality so that she could also
decorate this tower.

Desc       This nymph wears a silk gown in a soft green the color of spring
shoots, and on her head is a small circlet woven from leaves.  Although
you cannot be sure in this light, it also appears that her skin is
tinged green, and while this is strange to you, you cannot help but admire her
beauty and grace.  She was born to a magical plant which grows in the gardens
of Olympus, and while she appears fragile, she also possesses the
resilience of all plant life, which fade away with each winter but know that
they will bloom again in the spring sun.

Long       Helios, Circe's father, looks out over the rising sun.
~
Desc       At first glance Helios appears to be surrounded by a glowing
light, but then you realize that Helios himself is emitting that light.  He
is the god of the sun, and it seems that he has taken on the characteristics of
the sun he, strangely enough, both worships and rules.  A quick peek at his
face frightens you, not because he seems evil, but his expression is
fiercely stern.  Like most other immortals, Helios' age is
indistinguishable, but his brief toga reveals that his body is strong.

that are
colored a blueish-green.  Nevertheless, her strange coloring only
serves to enhance her timeless beauty and grace, and she seems so ethereal
that you cannot believe that she is actually standing before you.  She is
garbed completely in garments made from the fruits of the sea, and while
she knows you are an intruder she looks at you with a calm and gentle
smile.

shimmering black, which swirl around her as though moved by some unknown
force. Her eyes and hair too are pitch black, and the threatening anger
in her expression makes you wonder what you have done to offend her.  But
then you realize that malevolence is an intrinsic part of her nature,
and that it is almost expected that she dislikes you, for she wishes to do harm
to all mortals.

~
Desc       Circe, unlike her sister, has inherited only the best parts of her
parents physical features, and she is the most beautiful person you have
ever seen.  But wait!  You have to struggle to remind yourself that Circe is
not human, and that her reputation and what you have seen in this tower show
that her beauty is not indicative of her nature.  In fact, Circe can be
either extremely kind and gentle, as with her family, chosen handmaidens
and other immortals, or wickedly cunning.  Presently, she smiles
seductively at you as she beckons you to join her.  A legend springs to your
mind: when Odysseus came to this isle, he too overcame the trials of the
tower, and Circe, in finding herself in danger, sought to seduce Odysseus and
thus trick and subdue him.

Desc       Some kind god has brought your ship safely into a harbor, and the
fair-haired Dawn shines gently upon you, comforting your weary body.
But beware, for you have arrived at the island of Aiaia, on which lives
Circe, the dread goddess who talks with mortals.  The gods have bestowed
their favors on you thus far, but now you walk in the realm of one who is
herself immortal, and you shall have to rely on your own wits and
courage.  Perhaps if you could think of another safe port near here, you
could have fled from this place, but your supplies are low, and thus, you
shall have to hunt on this isle, and perhaps even face Circe herself.

which have been circulated about this isle have dissuaded even the
bravest of explorers from coming here.  And over time, even these stories
have faded to the dimmest of memories in the minds of mankind.  There
are some who now scoff at the existence of Circe, saying she is nothing
but a myth created to scare young children.  But now you know that she
really exists, for her tower, whole and intact, looms before you to the

Desc       There are numerous statues here, but these were not obviously not valued
pieces of art, for moss has been allowed to gather on them and some of
them are even cracked.  Instead, you get the feeling that these statues were
thrown out for being "unworthy" and left here to decay in the elements.
However, these statues are so lifelike that you could almost imagine them
to have been actual people who were turned to stone.  The faces of the
statues are twisted in either fear or disgust, and a vague idea enters your
mind that perhaps these were people cursed by Circe.

the earth to rise into this room, and that water forms a small pool in the
back corner of the room.  The pool is filled with brightly colored fish and
the soft tinkling of the water lends an aura of serenity to this room.

Desc       How wonderful!  Circe appears to be quite the scholar, for she has
collected rare and valuable manuscripts and books from around the world
and placed them here.  The shelves are lined with these treatises, and as
you peruse them, you see works dating back from the Mesopotamian and
Egyptian dynasties.

Desc       Delicate pastel-colored paints have been applied to these walls, recreating
scenes from the sea.  On a blue background, green vines swirl gently,
dusty pink corals are scattered around, grey fish dart amongst the plant-
life, and a merman stands proudly overlooking all this splendor.  Circe's
mother was born from the sea, and it appears that Circe has not forgotten
this part of her heritage, for she has brought the glories of the sea
into her home.

You are dwarfed by the hall, and feel overwhelmed by it even though it is
aesthetically pleasing to your eyes.  The hall is bright and airy, and 
marble
statues of slender nymphs smile at you from its corners.  The drapes have
been drawn on the north end of this room, allowing you a view onto the
patio which leads out from here, and beyond that, onto the smooth lawns
of the courtyards.

side of it, is the centerpiece of this banquet room.  You cannot help but
gape at the table, for by its size, you guess that it must weigh at least
a ton. How in the world was this carried here?  The room is otherwise empty
of decoration, except for the windows which stretch to the ceiling, allowing
sunlight to stream in and affording you a pleasing view of the gazebo
outside..

Desc       This kitchen has been fitted with all the necessary cooking utensils, and a
large fireplace with a spit lies in its southern wall.  However, upon closer
examination you notice that the kitchen appears to have never been used.
The pots and other implements bear no stains whatsoever, and the
fireplace is empty and completely clean of soot.  It appears that Circe
conjures up meals for her guests by using her magic, and thus this kitchen
has lain empty since the building of the tower.  Nonetheless, you notice
that the oven door is slightly ajar.

her prisoners until she can discern their talents and decree their fate.
Although you cannot think of a name other than "dungeon" for this room
that lies  in the depths of the earth, it is unlike any dungeon you have
previously seen.  It is spotlessly clean and numerous torches hang from the
walls, emitting bright glows of light which make this place seem less
threatening.  There are simple doors, with barred windows, to your east
and west.

would willingly submit to her.

has molded clay into the form of a woman, and a partially sewn garment

wood and fine cloth, some of which have been sliced into rectangles,
suitable for scrolls or letters, or bound together to form blank books.
There is also a set of finely tipped quills and a collection of different 
inks
on a small table here, and on that table is a small pile of letters and a
partially completed manuscript.  The letters seem to be addressed to
scholars in various parts of the land, and most express thanks for imparted
information.  However, you then notice that the manuscript has been
written by a different hand -- while the letters are written in a bold
lettering, the manuscript appears to have been scripted by a female hand,
and the writing on it is graceful and curved.

Desc       This is where Circe's servants prepare the magical potions she sometimes
uses, and where they collect her favorite nectar, ambrosia.  The wooden
shelves are filled with ingredients and bottles.  Some of the ingredients
which you recognize are blueberries, various wildflowers, sand, and scales
from a reptile, while some of the bottles are filled with colored liquids
which you dare not taste.  One bottle, however, catches your eye.  It is
filled with a thick yellowish liquid, and the scent coming from it is so
heavenly and unusual that you almost place the bottle to your lips.  You
realize that this must be ambrosia; but ambrosia is the nectar of the gods,
and although sweet, a mere sip of ambrosia is reputed to mean only death
for mortals such as yourself.

not normal clear glass but glass in every hue and shade imaginable.  The
colors of this glass are so dazzling that you momentarily feel dizzy and
confused.  You realize that while this hallway is wonderfully beautiful,
your mortal's eyes cannot stand the sight of this kaleidoscope of colors for

Desc       This is a small room meant for study and meditation.  However, this room
is not used by Circe, but by the apprentices who are sent to her to learn 
the
arts of magic.  The walls of the room have been painted a pale, soothing
cream, and the large windows here provide views to the sky, sea and
gardens (the sources of an immortal's strength) which lie outside.  There
are also books and scrolls filled with magical spells here, which are
memorized and later practiced, by Circe's apprentices.

Desc       This is the room where Circe's master carpenter carves wood into shapes
suitable for use as staffs and wands.  Thus, the room is filled with logs of
wood amassed from around the world; among those you recognize oak
and birch, willow and pine, exotic teak and rosewood, maple and olive.
Circe has taught her carpenter rudimentary skills, and thus he is able to
create certain staffs and wands alone, but those which will hold powerful
spells require Circe's touch.  Thus, while the shelves are lined with
intricately patterned staffs and simply shaped wands, you cannot tell those
which have been charged which spells from those which are nothing but
plain wood.

Desc       This is the room where the women who serve as Circe's healers work.
They diligently and tirelessly mix and grind ingredients with mortar and
pestle, creating salves with almost magical healing properties.  On the
large table in this room you notice ingredients such as seaweed, coral,
beets, mushrooms, roots and grain -- all commonplace, but only Circe and
those she has trained know the secrets of mixing these together.  Mortals
from around the world often beg Circe for these salves, for they have been
known to cure anything from sores to the most dire of illnesses.  However,
the price demanded by Circe for these healing salves is often high, and it
is by trading these that Circe has collected many of the treasures which
adorn her home.

Desc       This is the room where Circe's dyers collect components for and produce
the dyes used for her clothing and tapestries, and the inks for her writing.
The most valued of dyes is that which is purple, for purple is said to be 
the
color of the gods.  Purple dye is also the most difficult to make, for it
requires a substance which can only be obtained from conch shells.
However, fresh, large conches produce the most vibrant purple dye, and as
these may only be captured from the darkest depths of the sea, this kind of
dye is extremely rare.  Nonetheless, Circe is a daughter of the sea, and she
often travels there to collect conches for her use.  Therefore, you see 
large
bottles of this revered purple dye placed on the shelves here.

slightly raised platform for Circe to sit in during her meetings, and there 
is
a soft rug of grey on the ground.  But there are no other furnishings, and 
it
appears that Circe demands that her workers stand while she sits and

and their knowledge of human anatomy, for each statue seems is a perfect
replica of what men and women should look like.  The statues are in a
variety of poses, some showing women with soft, voluptuous bodies in
togas reclining on benches; some showing men in combat, muscles
rippling as they grapple against each other.  One particular statue catches
your eye for it has been set off in a corner by itself: it is crafted from a
pink-veined marble and depicts a regal woman who seems to stare down
aloofly at you as though your mortal concerns are beneath her.  At the
base of the statue are inscribed these words: "Circe of the lovely hair,
dread goddess who talks with mortals."

second of the men confronting a woman and being turned into pigs, the
third of one final man challenging the woman, and the last of the hero and
the woman embracing.  You realize that this must be a rendition of the

have actually loved him if she commisioned this tapestry.

while others have hilts in which all kinds of precious stones have been
embedded.  Most of the weapons have been placed close together, but on
the far wall only two weapons -- a slender sword made of the finest
flexible metal and a small ruby-encrusted dagger -- are hung.  This sword
and dagger obviously occupy a place of honor in this display, and you
surmise that these must be Circe's personal weapons.

Desc       Glass shelves hang on each wall from invisible brackets.  On each shelf
are different kinds of jewelry, all studded with precious gems.  The
jewelry includes hairpins, circlets, necklaces, chokers, rings, pins,
bracelets and ankle bracelets.  Each item is a work of art but you find
yourself thinking more about the wealth contained in this room than about
the craftsmanship.  By god, any of these pieces would feed a family for
years, you think.

Desc       The entire room has been decorated with an intricate and complicated
rendition of a large tree.  Upon closer inspection, you notice that each 
leaf
bears a name and that the branches link the trees together.  As you read
the names painted on the tree leaves, you realize that the tree maps the
bloodlines of each immortal.  The uppermost leaves bear the names of
Kronos and Rhea, and directly under that are the names of Zeus, Poseidon,
Hades, Hestia, Demeter, and Hera.  Because the immortals often chose to
marry their own siblings and often had children with numerous partners,
the branches of the tree have been painted to crisscross and loop.
Nonetheless, the artist who painted this managed to depict all this while
retaining the aesthetic beauty and form of the tree.

Desc       This is an altar built for Zeus, the father of the gods, who presides over 
the
gods on Mount Olympus.  Zeus is lord of the sky, the rain god, and the
cloud gatherer, who wields the terrible thunderbolt.  Zeus was the
youngest son of the Titans Kronos and Rhea, and the brother of the deities
Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Demeter, and Hera.  Kronos had been afraid of
being overthrown by one of his children, and thus Kronos had swallowed
all his children other than Zeus, who was hidden by Rhea.  When Zeus
grew to maturity, he challenged his father and forced Kronos to disgorge
the other children, who were eager to take vengeance on their father. In
the war that followed, the Titans fought on the side of Kronos, but Zeus
and the other gods were successful, and the Titans were consigned to the
abyss of Tartarus.  Zeus henceforth rules over the sky, and his brothers
Poseidon and Hades were given power over the sea and the underworld,
respectively.

Titans Kronos and Rhea, and the sister and wife of Zeus. Hera is the
goddess of marriage and the protector of married women.  She gave birth
to Ares, god of war; Hephaestus, god of fire; Hebe, goddess of youth; and
Ilithyia, goddess of childbirth.  Hera is a jealous wife, who often
persecutes Zeus's mistresses and children.  She never forgets an injury and
is also known for her vindictive nature.  Angry with the Trojan prince
Paris for preferring Aphrodite, goddess of love, to herself, Hera aided the
Greeks in the Trojan War and was not appeased until Troy was finally
destroyed.

Desc       This is the altar to Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.  It is said 
by
some that Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione, one of his
consorts, but some other legends tell that she sprung from the foam of the
sea.  Aphrodite is the wife of the lame and ugly god of fire, Hephaestus,
but among her lovers was Ares, god of war.  You have also heard tales of
how the Trojan War was started by Aphrodite.  Eris, the goddess of
discord, the only goddess not invited to the wedding of King Peleus and
the sea nymph Thetis, resentfully tossed into the banquet hall a golden
apple, marked "for the fairest."  Paris, prince of Troy, selected Aphrodite
as the fairest and asked Aphrodite to give him Helen of Troy, the wife of
the Greek king Menelaus, as a payment for choosing her.  Paris then
abducted Helen, an act which began the Trojan War.

Desc       This is the altar where Circe pays homage to Apollo, son of Zeus and
Leto, daughter of a Titan.  Apollo has many talents but is primarily a god
of prophecy, and his most important oracle is at Delphi, the site of his
victory over the Python. He sometimes gives the gift of prophecy to
mortals whom he loves, such as the Trojan princess Cassandra, and
therefore many pray to him in the hopes of gaining a view into the future.
Apollo is also known as a gifted musician, who delights the gods on
Mount Olympus with his performance on the lyre.  In addition, he is a
master archer and a fleet-footed athlete who acts as the special protector
of young men.  Apollo also acts as the god of agriculture, cattle and light
and truth, and many mortals revere him because he taught humans the art
of healing.

Ares are his consort, Aphrodite, goddess of love, and some minor deities
such as Deimos (Fear) and Phobos (Rout), who accompany him in battle.

Desc       This altar has been decorated with golden wheat, which has been placed
here to honor Artemis.  Being the daughter of the god Zeus and Leto and
the twin sister of the god Apollo, Artemis is one of the principal
goddesses.  She is chief hunter to the gods and goddess of hunting and of
wild animals, especially bears.  Artemis is also the goddess of childbirth,
of nature, of the moon and of the harvest.  In many ways, Artemis is the
female counterpart of her brother, and thus, while he associated with
young men, Artemis is traditionally also the friend and protector of youth,
especially young women.  Like Apollo, Artemis is armed with a bow and
arrows, which she often uses to punish mortals who anger her.  However,
she also uses her weapons for another reason: in other legends, she is
praised for giving young women who died in childbirth a swift and
painless death.

Desc       This is the altar where Circe worships Athena, who sprang full-grown and
armored from the forehead of the god Zeus, and who is Zeus' favorite
child.  Zeus entrusts Athena with his shield, adorned with the hideous
head of Medusa the Gorgon, his buckler, and his principal weapon, the
thunderbolt.  Athena plays many roles, but most people associate her with
the city of Athens and the Parthenon, both of which takes their names
from her -- as a virgin goddess, Athena is sometimes also referred to as
Parthenos, "the maiden."  Athena is primarily the goddess of the Greek
cities, of industry and the arts, of wisdom and of war.  In addition, she is 
a
patron of the agricultural arts and of the crafts of women, especially
spinning and weaving, and among her gifts to mortals  were the inventions
of the plow and the flute and the arts of taming animals, building ships,
and making shoes.

Desc       This is the altar where Circe worships the Fates, the three daughters of
Zeus and the Titan goddess Themis, who determine human life and
destiny.  The Fates apportion to each person at birth a share of good and
evil, although one might increase the evil by one's own folly.  Portrayed in
art and poetry as stern old women or as somber maidens, the goddesses
are always thought of as weavers.  Clotho, the Spinner, spins the thread of
life;  Lachesis, the Dispenser of Lots, decides its span and assigns to each
person his or her destiny; and Atropos, the Inexorable, carries the dread
shears that cut the thread of life at the proper time. The decisions of the
Fates cannot be altered, even by the gods, and therefore, they are both
revered and feared.

Desc       Precious metals and gems have been placed at this altar to honor
Hephaestus, god of fire and metalwork, the son of  Zeus and Hera.  In
contrast to the other gods, Hephaestus was born lame and awkward, and it
is rumored that shortly after his birth, he was cast out of Olympus, either
by Hera, who was repelled by his deformity, or by Zeus, because
Hephaestus had sided with Hera against him.  However, it is also said that
Zeus and Hera repented, and Hephaestus was soon honored again on
Olympus and was married to Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty. As
the artisan among the gods, Hephaestus makes their armor, weapons, and
jewelry.  His workshop is believed to lie under Mount Etna, a volcano in
Sicily, and the inhabitants of Sicily are therefore his most devout
worshippers.

Zeus and of Maia, the daughter of the Titan Atlas.  As the special servant
and courier of Zeus, Hermes uses winged sandals and a winged hat and
bears a golden Caduceus, or magic wand, entwined with snakes and
surmounted by wings.  Hermes conducts the souls of the dead to the
underworld and is believed to possess magical powers over sleep and
dreams.  Hermes is also the god of commerce, and the protector of traders
and herds.  As the deity of athletes, he protects gymnasiums and stadiums
and is known to be responsible for both good luck and wealth.
Nonetheless, despite his virtuous characteristics, Hermes is also a
dangerous foe, who can delight in tricks and thievery.

has soft, puffy clouds hanging above it; one is made of packed earth; one
is constructed of seaweed and coral; one has vines and flowers springing
from it; and on the last bed sit a number of small animals.  These
handmaidens are the youngest daughters of minor deities and humans.
But because they only hold the lowest positions in the hierachy of the
gods, and because their mixed blood denied them immortality, they chose
to serve Circe here, in the hopes that they would learn magic from here
and that they would gain favors from the gods.

Desc       There are exotic animals lying around this small building.  Most seem
tame and friendly, and you smile in wonder and admiration at Circe's
magical abilities.  Somehow she has managed to erase the barriers of fear
and hostility which exist between men and beasts, and the animals which
purr at you are proof that men need not always subdue animals with
violence.  Then you notice something which seems incongruous in this
place -- a pen.  You peer into the pen and notice an animal pacing steadily
around inside it.  Why did Circe have this pen built when she could have
easily tamed the animal with her magic?

Desc       You stand in a large cage with gold and platinum bars.  The ground
underfoot has been lined with soft, clean hay and there is are two dishes
here, one filled with succulent meats and another with fresh water.  It
appears that although the animal which lives here is trapped, it is
nonetheless treated well.  Perhaps your assumption that this animal is wild
was wrong:  Circe may have placed this valuable animal here to protect it
from intruders such as yourself, and not because she wished to subdue or
tame it.

around this small building.  Birds from around the globe circle around
you, some chirp sweet songs, some squawk almost angrily at you, and
some send out calls which seem filled with dignity.  The birds do not
appear to have been chained or to have their wings clipped, but they seem
content to fly around this small building as though they were magically
charmed to stay here.  But wait!  Why is there a birdcage in the next
room?  You would have thought that Circe would have no need to cage
one of her tamed birds...

Desc       It is dark here, and you cannot see into the cage, so you reach your hand
into its large opening, hoping to catch whatever bird is in it.
Unfortunately, the bird seems to sense that you are an uncouth intruder,
and pecks sharply at your fingers.  Ouch!  Well that didn't work very well.
You decide to crawl in through the opening, and luckily it is large enough
for you to fit through.  You see a glorious peacock wandering around in
here, and as it fans out its tail, you realize why it is so prized by Circe: 
its
feathers are gold and silver and light blue, making it one of the most
beautiful birds you have ever laid eyes on.

Desc       The rich scent of spices and fruits fill your nostrils as you enter this 
room.
Rare herbs and other ingredients have been harvested by Circe's workers
and placed here, ready to be used for healing purposes.  You can hear the
sound of water bubbling, as though it is boiling, coming from somewhere
nearby, but you cannot locate the source of that sound.

Desc       This room has no furniture to speak of, and its main feature is a huge
cauldron that hangs suspended over cackling logs.  A stirring paddle sits
in the cauldron, and a sweaty woman stands watching the contents of the
cauldron, stirring it intermittently.  You quickly glance into the boiling
depths of the cauldron, and notice that what is in it is the shade of a
putrescent green.  You are curious about the liquid's purpose, but you
decide not to investigate it further, for the color and pungent smell of the
liquid, and the heat from the fire make you decidedly wary of getting too
close to the cauldron.

Desc       The room here is lined with plain wooden shelves, but you hardly have
time to wonder at the simplicity of these shelves (which are unusual in
this highly ornamented tower), because your attention has been caught by
the array of shells lying on them.  Conch shells of all sizes have been
placed here, but it appears that only the largest of these have been kept,
while smaller shells have been discarded in a barrel that lies at the end of
the room.  The spikes of the shells give them the appearence of being
armored, but some of them have been turned over, and you can see that
their inner shells, in contrast, are a soft, glowing pink.

continuously stirring it and sometimes adding water or other unknown

Desc       Simple shelves line two of the walls of this room, while a small door,
currently locked, leads into the oven where the pottery is fired.  The
shelves are filled with various pieces of pottery, in various stages of
completion.  Some are drying and waiting for their initial firing, some
have been fired and are waiting to have glaze applied on them, and some
have just been taken out of the oven after their final firing.  There are 
also
large pots, filled with glazes, here, as well as brushes and other
implements for shaping and scraping.

Desc       The stench here is almost unbearable, and as you look around at the
carcasses strewn here, you shudder when you notice a skeletal hand
reaching out in perpetual agony.  But even more frightening is the vortex
of churning white water which is visible through a large natural hole in
the rock at your feet.  The water hurls itself against the rock, and its 
roar
is deafening.  However, as you grow accustomed, if not comfortable, with
the sound of the crashing water, you notice another sound coming from
the back of the cave which somehow manages to make you forget the
threat of the water.  It is the wailing of a woman, and her voice holds
within it all the anger and wrath of the world.
