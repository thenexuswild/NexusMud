Desc       Father Time isn't quite what you expected.  You expected him to look old and 
act young, but somehow you didn't expect him to be a 70's throwback.  He's 
wearing a powder blue polyester leisure suit with a wide, flaring collar and  
bell-bottom pants that flap around his ankles as he walks.  Around his neck 
hangs a delicate hourglass on a chain.

It's worse.  It towers over you and chomps its dagger-long teeth together, 
savoring how good you'll taste.  Your blood turns to icewater, and you begin  
to think seriously about running away.

Desc       The triceratops is _big_.  Like its name suggests, there are three horns coming
out of its head, and a large bony plate protects it from many attacks.  More 
than anything else you've seen, it looks like an enormous rhinoceros.  I  
wouldn't agitate it...

Desc       The pterodactyl is pretty intimidating.  Not too surprising, since it towers 
over you, and its wingspan is more than enough to wrap you up and hold you 
immobile several times over.  It appears more interested, however, in just  
trying to beat you off of the cliff with them...

mewls at you, almost as if it would like you to come over and pat it on the 
head.

It is about 30 feet long and covered in greenish scales.  Oh yes, the teeth.  
There are quite a lot of them, and they look very sharp.  Definitely not the

Desc       As a child you were always taught that this thing was called a brontosaurus, 
but now it's called an apatosaurus.  It is absolutely enormous, but looks 
docile enough.  As you look at it, it stands up on its hind feet and reaches 
high into the trees with its long neck to grab another hunk of leaves.  It 
might be better not to aggravate it.  That tail looks like it could smack you 
pretty hard...

tooth (yes, there's only one left) sticks straight out, and is yellower than 
the banana you had for breakfast this morning.  His enormous gut hangs from

mention they get paid pretty well.  Surprisingly, they don't seem to take very 
good care of their equipment, though.  Perhaps it's because they just like

his only goal is money.  I'd watch out if I were you.  He doesn't look very 
honest, and might try to pull something on you...

better run  - but wait a minute...there aren't any exits from this room.  The 
daemon is holding a packet of compressed data in his clutches.  He'll protect 
it to the death.

mention is that some of the mobs in one portion of this area have names that 
are pretty hard-to-type.  It'll be obvious what I'm talking about when you get

Desc       You stand in a nicely furnished room.  There is a ring of recliners and sofas 
here, and a coffee table covered with magazines sits in the center.  You 
think about picking up a copy of "Mud Shopper" and ordering yourself a new
shotgun, but realize that you don't have that much credit.  Oh well.  You'll 
have to get that elusive tool of ultimate destruction the hard way.  But 
while you're here, you might as well take a trip through time.  There are four 
doors here, one in every direction.

you and begin spinning faster, faster, faster, and you get dizzy and fall

honking noises.  What an odd place this must be...

Desc       You step west into a flashing array of lights.  Waves of light wrap around you 
and begin spinning faster, faster, faster, and you get dizzy and fall down, 
trying to keep track of the spinning lights.  The lights finally begin to 
slow, and as they stop you stand up and look around.  All you can see is stars, 
and the night sky surrounds you on all sides.  A glimmering blob of light 
appears in the distance and rushes towards you, coalescing around you 
just as the force-bubble dissolves.  With your friendly lightblob protecting 
you from the harsh vacuum of space, you should be able to move around 
relatively safely, as long as you don't do anything stupid, of course.  
The blob of light carries you through space and deposits you in what 
appears to be the docking bay of a space station.

shrivel, aging at an accelerated rate.  You notice your equipment slowly 
turning to dust around you as your bones crumble and fall to the floor in a

of the temple.  A downtrodden, rusty lamp gives off a dim light, and a few  
beat-up old bean-bag chairs are all that the room has to offer in the way of 
furniture.  Father Time looks at you and says "Hi there, welcome to my office.  
What can I do for you?"

not.  The air is dank and stale, just about like you'd expect an old pyramid 
to be.

Desc       Wow!  You've always wanted to experience the joy of free-fall.  Of course, this 
isn't exactly the best place to do it.  You take a few moments to enjoy the 
exhilaration of flying through the blackness at terminal velocity before you 
come to an awful conclusion.  Either this pit truly is bottomless, in which 
case you're a goner, or there's a bottom somewhere down there, and you're 
going to hit it REALLY hard.  Perhaps this wasn't the safest place to 
go.  Oh well.  You didn't need all that neat equipment anyway, did you?

stone, and if it weren't for your light, you'd have killed yourself running 
into walls long ago - it's really that dark in here.  There are stairs leading 
down to the First level, and a passageway to your west.

up the stairs, or head south along the tunnel.

the plain, and as you look around, you notice that quite a few of them show the 
signs of having been munched on recently.  A bloody bone sits in a large patch 
of stomped-down grass.  To the north is an unpassable mountain range.  To the

just stinks of bad government.  The road leads off to the north, south, and 
east, where you can see a large silver seal in the center of the road.

Desc       The cobblestone road ends here, at the entrance to some agricultural fields.  
Of course, there are so many weeds sticking out between the stones on the road 
that the field might actually start here...But no, there's an evil-looking  
tower to the west - the road looks like it leads there.  In addition to the 
fields to the north, there are also some to the east.  The tower lies west, 
and the road continues south to a T-intersection.

clump of weeds or stooping down to dig a carrot out of the soil.  This sure 
isn't a very cheery place.  The serfs all look underfed and utterly terrified 
- every now and then you can see one of them flick a frightened gaze at the 
drab castle to the east.  To the west and south lie the cobblestone road, and

hack away at the everpresent weeks with shoddy-looking hoes or carefully pick 
vegetables and stow them away in wicker baskets.  They all look absolutely 
terrible.  Quite a few of them sport heavy bruises, and they shy away from you 
in terror.  Perhaps you should leave and let them do their work in peace.

Desc       This is where the Wizard works with his magic.  Flasks and beakers, connected 
by a tangle of glass tubing, bubble and froth colorful liquids, and 
acrid-smelling smoke fills the air.  More bookshelves line the walls, and a 
skillfully - painted portrait of an old man in a robe and pointed hat hangs on 
the western wall.  He doesn't look like the kind of man you'd want even your 
worst enemy to meet.  An evil grin pulls at the corners of his mouth, and a 
blazing  ball of fire is in his hand.  If it weren't only a painting, you'd 
swear he was about to throw it at you.  The only exit from here is to go south, 
back to the staircase.

Desc       Unlike the rest of the tower, this room is downright cozy.  A fire roars in a 
brick fireplace, and soft gray carpet covers the floor.  Two cushioned chairs 
sit in front of a polished wooden desk.  A window behind the desk gives a  
view of the fields, where serfs are slaving away at pulling weeds and 
harvesting crops.  East is the staircase, and a stout metal door lies north.  
An evil-looking old man sits at the table, reading a book entitled "People who 
Fear Wizards and the Wizards who Tyrannize Them."  He chuckles at something he 
reads in the book, then looks up and notices you.  Oops...

three hourglasses imprinted into the seal.  Two yellow stripes go down the 
center of the smooth road.  Isn't that odd?  Why would anyone ever bother to  
do a stupid thing like that.  The horses might get confused or something.  The 
road continues to the north, south, east, and west.  Intermittent horns, load 
music, and thin smog fill the air.

gasp in disbelief.  Why, they want 1,000,000 credits for a stinking waybread!  
You'll have to remember to bring your own stash some other time.  But there is 
one good thing - there's a large sign that says "Today Only - Free Tickets for

lights dim and the screen lights up with previews of upcoming attractions, 
including "War of the Tulips", "Lowlander IV - the Boring" and "Star Journeys 
X - Jim Lives."  Then finally, the main attraction begins.  It really isn't 
very good.  Something about some old geezer in a hockey mask who runs around 
cutting up teenagers at a summer camp.  The worst thing is that all the  
screaming keeps waking you up from your nap.  Finally, the movie is over, and 
people begin to file out of the theatre.  *sigh*  Oh well.  Perhaps you really 
should get back to adventuring.  Sitting through another showing of Monday the 
11th probably wouldn't add very much to your life.  The only exit is east, back 
to the theatre foyer.

Desc       The entrance to the bank is what you'd expect to see in a successful 
instituition like this one.  Well lit, with nice - looking but conservative 
paintings on the walls.  Looking around, you can see polished oak desks where 
the bank's officers do their work.  To the east, you see a loan officer's desk. 
South is a waiting area, where you can wait if  you'd like to see a teller.  
Going north or west will take you outside back onto the road.

oak desk and a swiveling chair that looks quite comfortable.  Two 
leather-upholstered chairs sit in front of the desk.  Currently, the desk is 
covered with paper, about half of which bears a big red "REJECTED" stamp.  
West is the bank entrance, and south is a teller window.

deposits, transfers - you name it, they'll take care of it here.  However, if 
the look on the face of the teller here is any indication, the job doesn't 
breed a compassionate disposition.  He looks at you sourly and demands, 
"Account number and type of transaction?"  North is the loan officer's desk, 
and east will take you to the waiting area.

and a mess hall is to the west.

Desc       Wow!  What a great view of the stars!  Looking out the large window here you 
can see the galaxy outside as the space station slowly spins around.  
Stationary bicycles, treadmills, and weightlifting equipment line the walls 
here -  the spacers have to do something to keep in shape, after all.  The 
only exit is west, to the hallway.

Desc       Here is the dreaded mess hall, where the station's inhabitants have to suffer 
through meals.  The smell of grease and unhealthy preservatives fill the air 
here, and you thank the powers that be that you don't have to eat whatever it 
is that's served here.  A small kitchen counter abuts the northern wall, and 
although clean, it seems to be the source of the stench.  Two plastic tables 
have been set up here for the spacers to eat at.  The only exit is east, back 
to the hall.

Desc       What an interesting place.  The inside of the computer looks like no place 
you've even seen.  Space is not 3-dimensional here, but exists only as an 
intricate web of one-dimensional flows of current.  Somehow you can still  
perceive yourself as normal, although you know that you're just another packet
of binary code flowing through the computer's innards.  It seems as if you're 
in some kind of a maze.  The only way you can proceed is east.

the inside of the computer.  You've hit a corner here, and the only options 
along your path of current are to go north and west.

Desc       The web of electricity that serves as space-time here splits off in different 
directions here.  The path you've been following seems to curve off to the east
and south, but if you're subtle enough, you can slip through on a thinner flow 
that leads to the west, towards a data storage area.

Desc       You're standing within an electronic data storage cylinder.  The "walls" of 
the well stretch above and beneath you as far as you can see, but you're 
completely stable on your thin flow of current.  There's no need to worry.  
Along the "wall" of the data well, you can see protrusions from the side of 
the wall - each is covered with bits of data.  As you look closer, you realize
that each protrusion is covered with protrusions, and those are covered with 
still more.  And each and every protrusion you can see is literally blanketed 
with information.  You cannot begin to imagine the amount of data that is 
stored here.  The only way out is east, along your flow.

and look for a way to get through, but there just isn't any way.  Perhaps you

Desc       Whee!  The flow of data through the switch is more than you can keep track of, 
and you're picked up and hauled along.  You twist and turn through a myriad of
electrical flows, and if you weren't digitized, you'd lose your breakfast for 
sure.  Thank goodness for modern technology.  Eventually the flow slows down, 
and you stablilize your position.

Desc       The mazelike web of electric flows is a little more intense now.  Not so much 
of an increase in power as an increase in intensity.  You feel like something 
is watching you.  No, not "watching", but more like monitoring.  You suspect  
that every move you make is being recorded and dumped into a file somewhere.  
You'd better be careful not to make any embarassing mistakes.  The only way to
proceed from here is north.

Desc       The flow splits off here.  The path of least resistance leads to the north and
west, but you think that you've got enough control over your movements that 
you could take a path of slightly higher resistance to the south if you really
wanted to.  All of your physics professors said electricity always followed 
the path of least resistance?  Well, this is only fantasy after all :)...

Desc       The flow of electricity gets weaker here, but much more focused, and the 
feeling of being watched increases.  There is a switch to your west, but your 
flow doesn't lead into it - perhaps you need some sort of a code to open 
yourself to it.  You can also go south, where the flow splits.

Desc       This switch feels much different from the first one you went through.  There 
is very little flow of information here,  and you feel isolated from everything
else, as if each little bit of information that makes the digital being you've  
become is being inspected through a magnifying glass.  The flow weaves and 
turns slowly, and you begin to notice a massive electronic entity at the end of
the flow.  You can see him now.  He doesn't really look very happy to see 
you...
