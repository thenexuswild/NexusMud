god can match magical power with a Pit Fiend, but he can be controlled by any

Desc       You are walking through what was once a great temple.  Many tapestries
describing horrible creatures coming and destroying the world hang on the
walls. In the center of the temple there is a large dais, and behind it an
altar made of a silvery-white material.  Hanging over the altar is a large
ebony statue of a horrible fiend holding the head of a human child in one 
hand, and a huge sword in the other.  The black ebony sword seems to be 
surrounded by a dim red glow that illuminates the dark temple. 
There is an aisle leading directly south.

on as far as you can see.  For some strange reason, the horrible demons 
that fly in the dark skies seem to watch over you, but not attack.  The 
red glow seems to have dimmed slightly as you near it, but is still 
glowing clearly in the black fog of this dreaded place.  Streams of ebony
black water block your passage east and west.

Desc       The flat, pitch-black plane of ebony stone of the Abyss seems to comtinue 
on as far as you can see.  For some strange reason, the horrible demons 
that fly in the dark skies seem to watch over you, but not attack.  The 
black river blocks your passage south, and another magical force blocks 
your way north.  As you follow the river to the south, you see the cave 
getting closer and closer.

blazing red eyes glaring at you from the darkness of the cave.

must be a cruel and evil sorcerer, or perhaps, considering the state

to sacrifice you to some evil deity, perhaps the one worshiped in the

see the black ground of yet another level of the Abyss.

demons, they do not attack.  It is a very unnerving experience.  Suddenly, 
the specteral demons begin to scream very loudly, an ear-shattering cry that 
pierces your very soul.  Then, they all charge towards you.  Right before 
you are sure they will tear you apart, they stop. Then they all turn a misty 
white, and dissapear.  Everything is silent, and even more unnerving than 
when the ghosts were around.

Abyss, the flying demons finally fly down to attack you.  You can see no 
more staircases in any direction you look, and that portal may have been 
your only way out.  Now all you can do is continue on into the Pit of the

begin to glide down towards you, rage and fury burning in their red eyes.  
A very dark cloud of fog can be seen far to the south, no doubt the 
entrance to the Pit.  You can hear the crys  rising and the ear-

Desc       As you enter the dark cloud, you are totally engulfed by the black vapor 
and magically pulled into the darkest place you have ever seen, the Pit 
of the Abyss.  Even with your light, this place remains pitch-black, and 
the only was you can find your way around is by feeling the ground.  
Better hope there are no rivers here.

is probably not very fond of light.  You sense a very powerful presence 
waiting inside the cave.

Desc       Like most of the other caves, this one is not large, but not very small 
either.  It must be the lair of a fiend, which is not a very comforting 
thought.  The entire cave is surrounded by a red aura, and the flying 
demons seem to cringe away from it.  Either it is a solace in this evil 
place, or something very fierce lairs inside.

It is, however, the most feared fiend in all of the Abyss, and a sight no
