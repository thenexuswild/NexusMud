Desc       You are standing in the workshop of Froboz the Great, the most powerful and 
famous mage that Rome has ever known.  Workbenches line the walls and are
covered with various test tubes, beakers, petri dishes and crucibles and there
is an odor in here that can best be described as a combination of old sweat
socks and burning tires.  The only exit is back through the door through which
you came.  In the middle of the room, you see a pile of ashes that looks like 
it once was a body and Froboz is is busy making adjustments on a new type of 
magic wand .... possibly the one responsible for the explosion a few minutes 
ago.  He removes a jeweler's loupe from his eye as he turns around.  "How in 
the name of Merlin did you get in here??!!" he asks.  "Oh, nevermind!  Since 
you are here, you can serve as witnesses to the final test of the new mage's 
spell:  'ectowatt'."  With this he makes a magical gesture and the Paladin 
Knight appears.  Crossing his fingers, Froboz waves the wand his direction and 
what happens next is incredible!  The Paladin is enveloped in what appears to 
be a small, well contained, thermonuclear explosion.  When the smoke clears 
you can see that the Paladin and all of equipment has been reduced to a large 
pile of flaming cinders.  Froboz throws his head back and cackles with insane 
glee.  "Now, my young friends, what can I do for you?" he asks.
