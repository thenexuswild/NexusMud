Desc       Before you stands one of the laziest people you've ever 
seen.  Aladdin lives in this opulent palace only because he 
was saved from having to learn an honest trade by the Jinni 
of the Lamp.  He's wearing scarlet satin robes trimmed in 
royal blue.  On his ring finger is a gold ring with a large 
sapphire set in it.  He seems very proud of the ring, and 
he's always holding it up to admire it in the light.

consider yourself fortunate if you manage to find the path 
out in time to live, still carrying anything you entered 
with.  Behind the golden door lies a weapon of great worth, 
but fear for your life if you try to retrieve it.  If you 
are still feeling brave, then go forth foolish mortal and 
attempt to acquire it.  When your life is crushed out of you 
though, don't say I didn't try to warn you.

Desc       A feeling of terror comes over you, and you look up to see 
huge boulders come crashing down on you.  You hear your 
bones grind and crunch, and you feel your flesh get mashed 
to a bloody, pulpy mess.  Why is it taking you such an 
agonizingly long time to die?  Too bad that nifty equipment 
you're wearing couldn't protect you from these huge 
boulders.  Finally, your screams of agony and pain become 
just echos ringing through the passages, as your twitching 
remains stop moving and you die a horrible, excruciating, 
anguished death.

Desc       In front of you looms Aladdin's Palace.  Proudly guarding 
the enormous solid gold gates are a pair of red gold lions 
with eyes of sapphires.  The gleaming walls of alternating 
silver and gold bricks shine in the intense desert sunlight.  
Ninety-nine enormous windows decorate each wall, each of 
them adorned with glittering diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.  
On each corner a magnificent tower stands, constructed of 
porphyry, jasper, agate, and the finest marble, each with a 
sparkling crystal dome atop it.  You can hardly believe the 
sheer wealth that the palace represents.

Desc       You stand at the edge of a narrow, yet extraordinarily deep 
gorge in the desert.  The walls of the canyon are sheer 
cliff, and the only means of crossing to the other side is a 
fragile-looking rope bridge that extends across the gap.  On 
the other side you can see the lush vegetation of a tropical 
oasis.  Beware though...strange sandstorms have been known 
to come up out of nowhere and tear through the gorge.  You 
wouldnt want to be caught in one of those while on that rope 
bridge.

Desc       The first grains of sand start to sting your skin as the hot 
air flowing through the canyon picks up intensity, rapidly 
approaching a raging sandstorm.  It's not too far to the 
shelter of the oasis, though.  Perhaps if you hurry, you can 
make it in time...

Desc       Ack.....that sandstorm was moving a little faster than you 
thought, huh?  Unfortunately no one will ever know what 
became of you as the millions of tiny grains of sand scoured 
every inch of flesh and muscle off your skeleton and then 
ground the bones to a fine powder, carrying away all trace 
of your sorry existence.

Desc       As you enter the small, hidden bedroom, you are astonished 
to see the figure of Shahrazad before you.  For one thousand 
and one nights, the lovely Shahrazad regaled King Shahryar 
with tales.  Betrayed by his first wife, the King vowed 
never to let a woman be unfaithful to him again, so he had 
her beheaded, and in his anger towards women, he took a new 
wife every day and had her executed the next morning.  
Enchanted by Shahrazad's tales, the King postponed her 
beheading every day for one thousand and one nights so that 
he might hear the next of her stories.  On the thousand and 
first night, at the end of her last story, King Shahryar 
discovered that his base desire for revenge had turned to 
love.

On her ring finger, you can see a powerful magical ring 
which she uses to store her knowledge of tales.  The power 
that the ring posesses is capable of unlocking any gate or 
portal.

Desc       In the very center of the palace courtyard is a small tower 
not visible from the outside.  This octagonal room must be 
kept cool by some mysterious magical means because desert 
sunlight floods in from every angle.  Large panels of glass 
make up the walls, and a crystal dome sits atop it.  Looking 
around you see the bedroom tower sits amidst the courtyard 
gardens that sit in the center of the walls of the rest of 
the palace.  Outside may be a barren desert, but within the 
protection of the walls the garden flourishes.  Streams 
ripple through the scented gardens, with its fountains and 
flowers and fruit trees.  In the midst of all this sunshine 
and beauty stands Princess Badr al-Budur, for this 
enchanting room is the bedroom that she shares with her 
husband, Aladdin.

front of a mysterious looking rock.  A faint cloud of dust 
remains from the band of forty mounted men that ride off 
into the distance.  They seem to have been thieves.  As you 
look closely at the rock, it seems that the men came from 
it.  Perhaps it contains a cave inside?  However, you don't 
see any doors in the rock...at least none with any handles 
to open them.  Maybe there's another way to get the door to 
open...maybe it was something that they said to get it 
open....

Desc       Although smaller than the main cavern, this chamber is still 
spacious, yet it is bare.  You wonder why anyone would go to 
all the trouble to conceal an empty cave.  As you step 
further inside, though, you notice a gleaming gold door set 
in the back wall.  Curiousity piqued, you step towards it to 
open it, but are stopped by an angry looking man.  What's 
his problem anyway?  It's not like he has the keys to the 
door or anything...

Desc       You can't seem to see what's in that direction because of 
the silly door blocking your view.

was not careful, one could get hopelessly lost in here.  All

Rich bales of silk, brocade, and valuable carpeting piled 
one on top of the other, gold and silver ingots lying in 
great heaps, and money in bags.

Desc       Phew....that was close.  But hey, you made it.  Real 
mudders(tm) enjoy running through there and giving 
themselves adrenaline highs.  Come back and run through it 
again with all your neat equipment on when the zone resets.  
Or are you too chicken?? :)
