down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.

of beaten armour and broken blades lie all around. Examining the tracks here

directions, south and east.

Desc       You enter a large ring of boulders. Sheltered by this wall of stones, a small
cluster of plants have sprung up. In the center of this group of trees and
bushes is a huge gnarled tree. It appears to have been twisted and torn by
the forces of nature. It sways and moans as a strong wind from the south tears
through its old feeble branches. The hills themselves lead in all directions.

rotting away slowly in the gloomy darkness. In the back of the cave, you see a

towards the west.

Desc       This appears to be the main square of Mahn-Tor. A huge fountain graces the
center of the square, but the extreme cold has turned it into an ice
sculpture. The water has frozen in arcs through the air. Snow and ice covers
the square and small streets lead east and west. To the north, you see
the gates to the city. You also notice a small store to the south.
A small sign hangs outside the store.
